- **Nicotinic AChRs** – Ionotropic; mixed cation channel; blocked by alpha bungarotoxin, curare; different subunit composition; some subunits make it Ca++ permeable; ACh binding to nAChRs end plate potential.
- **Muscurinc AChRs** – Metabotropic; blocked by atropine and scopolamine; can produce slow/fast EPSP or IPSP depending on the second messenger coupling; “M-current”; pre-synaptic inhibition; excitability.
