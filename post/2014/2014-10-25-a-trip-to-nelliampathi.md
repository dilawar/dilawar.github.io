Last week we went to Kerala for a wedding. The place of wedding was near to Palakkad. Palkkad can be a good base for further trekking. It has many lodges and costly hotels (whichever you prefer). From here, one can take a bus to Nelliampathi village. It takes approximately 2.5 hours to reach the village. Last bus from the village to Palakkad is at 5:30 pm; so plan accordingly. There is small eating place at the bus-stop which is pretty good, and they don't over-charge you for anything. \[caption id="attachment\_1726" align="alignnone" width="2560"\]![bus](images/bus.jpg) Photo Credit: Anushree N\[/caption\] The hike through tea plantation was awesome.
