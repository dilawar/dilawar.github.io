I often try to remember how much each mode of transportation costs the environment. [Data published by UK government](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TAMZLvUrMlxAR4RdDOs928-yoU5RxMrDKIb8tXuOKsc/edit?hl=en_GB&hl=en_GB#gid=0) has good numbers. These data can probably be used as proxy for India with some caveats. The buses emit more carbon and almost certain to carry many more passengers; same goes with trains. I could not find such numbers published for any Indian city. Let's assume that

- A plane carries 100 passengers.
- A train carries 1000 passengers.
- A car carries 4 passengers.
- A bus carries 100 passengers.
- A bike carries 2 passengers.

Following is the value of cost per person per kilometer (roughly, rounded up for easy to remember). **1 flight = 10 cars = 20 bikes = 50 bus = 100 Trains!** It means, "If you travel in a fully occupied flight for a kilometer, it costs environment equal to 10 car kilometers (with 3 co-passengers), 20 bike kilometers (with 1 co-passengers), 50 bus kilometers (with 99 co-passengers), and 100 (diesel) train kilometers (with 999 co-passengers). The most environment-friendly mode of traveling is train. Bus is good choice for inter-city travel. If cars are fully occupied, they are as costly to environment as a bike. Cycling is the best!
