Global font size is set to 8 in all figures. \[gallery ids="1473,1474,1475,1476,1477,1478,1479,1480,1481,1482,1483,1484,1485,1486,1487,1490,1489,1488,1496" columns="2"\] Â  Style 'ggplot' is my first preference but the overlapping histogram does not have good contrast. So I settled for 'seahorse-darkgrid'.
