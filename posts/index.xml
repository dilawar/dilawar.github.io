It modifies the remote url and insert username and password (read from env) from it. No need to store ssh keys on remote server or git clone with https credentials.
For github.com repo, It looks for GITHUB_USER first, then for GIT_USER, and then USER environment variable. Similarly it looks for GITHUB_TOKEN, GIT_TOKEN for tokens. Fot gitlab.com repo, it looks for GITLAB_USER or GIT_USER or USER for username, and GITLAB_TOKEN, GIT_TOKEN for password.</description></item><item><title>Fixing 'cmake: symbol lookup error: cmake: undefined symbol: archive_write_add_filter_zst'</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2021/2021-07-02-fixing-cmake-symbol-lookup-error-cmake-undefined-symbol-archive_write_add_filter_zst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2021/2021-07-02-fixing-cmake-symbol-lookup-error-cmake-undefined-symbol-archive_write_add_filter_zst/</guid><description>I get the following error during build.

The standard way is numpy.save and numpy.load which works fine. My experience with opencv made me wonder if cv2.imwrite and cv2.imread can be used. The later saves the matrices to png file which works without any loss of data if you have 8 or 16 bit integer values in your matrices.</description></item><item><title>Convert webm file to WAV</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-12-13-convert-webm-file-to-wav/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-12-13-convert-webm-file-to-wav/</guid><description>Download the following script.

Data published by UK government has good numbers. These data can probably be used as proxy for India with some caveats. The buses emit more carbon and almost certain to carry many more passengers; same goes with trains. I could not find such numbers published for any Indian city. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that
A plane carries 100 passengers.</description></item><item><title>Humpty Dumpty</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-06-15-humpty-dumpty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-06-15-humpty-dumpty/</guid><description>Humpty Dumpty learned caution and care He climbed down the wall.

People are able to take finer personal distinctions in their businesses and other day-to-day work. In these societies, personal links can be used (or misused) for practically any purpose; and a certain sense of security is provided by the existence of such links. Now there are whole areas of life in complex industrial societies where such links are in principle irrelevant.</description></item><item><title>Comparision of various matplotlib/pylab plotting styles, version-1.(4, 5)</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-03-22-matplotlib-styles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-03-22-matplotlib-styles/</guid><description>Global font size is set to 8 in all figures.

There is small eating place at the bus-stop which is pretty good, and they don&amp;rsquo;t over-charge you for anything.</description></item><item><title>à¤¬à¤à¤ªà¤¨ à¤¯à¤¾à¤¦ à¤à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-09-11-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-09-11-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%88/</guid><description>à¤®à¥à¤à¥ à¤¬à¤à¤ªà¤¨ à¤¯à¤¾à¤¦ à¤à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥à¥¤ à¤¸à¥à¤¬à¤¹ à¤¸à¤µà¥à¤°à¥ à¤à¤ à¤¨à¤¾ à¤à¤° à¤¨à¤¹à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾ à¤®à¤à¤¦à¤¿à¤° à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾ à¤à¤° à¤à¤² à¤à¤¢à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾à¥¤ à¤ªà¤¾à¤ à¤¶à¤¾à¤²à¤¾ à¤à¤¾ à¤°à¤¾à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¤¾, à¤à¤¿à¤¤à¤¾à¤¬à¥ à¤à¤° à¤¬à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¤¾à¥¤ à¤®à¥à¤²à¥ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¥à¤¬à¥à¤¬à¤¾à¤°à¥ à¤à¤²à¥à¤¬à¥ à¤ªà¤° à¤®à¤à¤²à¤¨à¤¾, à¤¨à¤¹à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾ à¤¨à¤¹à¤° à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¤° à¤à¤®à¤²à¥ à¤ªà¤° à¤à¥à¤¨à¤¾à¥¤ à¤à¤°à¤¬à¥à¤à¥à¤ à¤à¤¾ à¤à¥à¤¤ à¤à¤à¤¸à¤° à¤¸à¤¤à¤¾à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥à¥¤ à¤®à¥à¤à¥ à¤¬à¤à¤ªà¤¨ à¤¯à¤¾à¤¦ à¤à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥à¥¤ à¤à¥à¤¤à¥ à¤à¥à¤¤à¥ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤¬à¤¿à¤à¤°à¤¨à¤¾, à¤«à¤¿à¤¸à¤²à¤à¤° à¤®à¥à¤¡ à¤¸à¥ à¤à¤¿à¤°à¤¨à¤¾, à¤­à¥à¤¯à¥à¤¯à¤¾ à¤¸à¥ à¤à¤à¥à¤¨à¤¾, à¤à¤° à¤à¤ªà¤¨à¥ à¤à¥à¤¤à¥à¤¤à¥ à¤¸à¥ à¤²à¥à¤¨à¤¾à¥¤ à¤®à¥à¤à¥ à¤à¤¬ à¤­à¥ à¤¹à¤à¤¸à¤¾à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥à¥¤ à¤®à¥à¤à¥ à¤¬à¤à¤ªà¤¨ à¤¯à¤¾à¤¦ à¤à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥à¥¤ à¤à¥à¥ à¤­à¤° à¤à¤¾ à¤°à¥à¤ à¤¨à¤¾, à¤à¤° à¤«à¤¿à¤° à¤¹à¤¸ à¤à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾ à¤¦à¤¾à¤¦à¥ à¤à¥ à¤¸à¤¾à¤¥ à¤¤à¤¾à¤¶ à¤à¥ à¤¬à¤¾à¥à¥ à¤à¤° à¤®à¤®à¥à¤®à¥ à¤à¤¾ à¤®à¤¨à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾ à¤¶à¤¹à¤¤à¥à¤¤ à¤à¥ à¤ªà¥à¥ à¤à¥ à¤à¤¹à¤¨à¥ à¤à¥à¤°à¤¿à¤à¥à¤ à¤à¤¾ à¤¬à¤²à¥à¤²à¤¾ à¤à¤¿à¤¨à¤¤à¥ à¤à¤° à¤ªà¤¹à¤¾à¥à¥ à¤¸à¥à¤à¥à¤² à¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥ à¤¹à¤²à¥à¤²à¤¾ à¤®à¤¾à¤¸à¥à¤® à¤¸à¤¾ à¤à¥à¤¹à¤°à¤¾, à¤à¤­à¥ à¤­à¥ à¤­à¤¾à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥ à¤®à¥à¤à¥ à¤¬à¤à¤ªà¤¨ à¤¯à¤¾à¤¦ à¤à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥à¥¤</description></item><item><title>Love and Life</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-09-08-love-and-life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-09-08-love-and-life/</guid><description>Rational man wondered If there is a good reason To keep on living, Or loving? &amp;ldquo;There is none!&amp;rdquo;, He proved.

Currently I am spending a year in NCBS Bangalore. I like to experiment with Operating Systems (OS). Needless to say, I download them often. And they can be pretty big (&amp;gt;500 Mb usually). In NCBS, speed is often poor but there is a catch. Speed over FTP is much better (upto 1 mb per sec) than it is over http (upto 100K per sec). Not all FTP servers are fast enough, some are pretty bad.</description></item><item><title>Race and Caste, revisited</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-11-17-race-and-caste/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-11-17-race-and-caste/</guid><description>As for the word race, it has so many different meanings, as to be useless in scientific discussion, to very useful for getting members of the same nation to hate one another. &amp;ndash; JBS Haldane

The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. In [1], authors describe the role of ephrin-A2 in regulating experience dependent, NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic pruning through glial glutamate transport during maturation of the mouse cortex.</description></item><item><title>Python front-end for Noweb literate tool</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-10-30-python-front-end-for-noweb-literate-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-10-30-python-front-end-for-noweb-literate-tool/</guid><description>The idea behind literate programming, that a program can be a piece of literature, is due to Donald E. Knuth. Knuth is an extremely respected figure in programming community (and also among combinatorics and computer science people). In this paradigm, one does not write a program based on how computer would reason about it but rather follows a human like flow. It is the job of literate programming tool to convert this human-readable program into something which make sense to a computer.</description></item><item><title>Intellectual commitments</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-10-20-intellectual-commitments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-10-20-intellectual-commitments/</guid><description>âI will pay my debt to society through research in my subject.

Hangman thinks of a word and tells you its length. You get that many chance to guess it. The procedure of guessing is following assuming length of the word is n.
You guess a letter, if the word contains that letter, hangman reveals the location of this letter. You still have n more guesses. If the word does not contain your letter, your no of guesses is reduced by 1.</description></item><item><title>Declarative languages and biological systems</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-10-08-declarative-languages-and-biological-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-10-08-declarative-languages-and-biological-systems/</guid><description>A program written in declarative paradigm does not specify &amp;ldquo;how to do it&amp;rdquo;, at best, it tells the computer &amp;ldquo;what to do&amp;rdquo;.

More adventurous among them argued that it does not exists therefore anything which is labeled as secular can only be pseudo-secular.</description></item><item><title>Mail server info of National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS) Bangalore</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-09-04-mail-server-info-of-national-center-for-biological-sciences-ncbs-bangalore/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-09-04-mail-server-info-of-national-center-for-biological-sciences-ncbs-bangalore/</guid><description>If you are a mutt user and working at NCBS Bangalore, you can setup your account in mutt as following. set from=&amp;quot;REAL_NAME &amp;quot; set from=&amp;quot;USER NAME &amp;quot; set hostname=&amp;quot;imaps://imap.ncbs.res.in&amp;quot; set folder=&amp;quot;imaps://imap.ncbs.res.in&amp;quot; set record=&amp;quot;+INBOX.Sent&amp;quot; set imap_user=&amp;quot;NCBS_USER&amp;quot; set imap_pass=&amp;quot;NCBS_PASS&amp;quot; set postponed=&amp;quot;=Drafts&amp;quot; set spoolfile=&amp;quot;+INBOX&amp;quot; set signature=&amp;quot;sign.txt&amp;quot; set smtp_url=&amp;quot;smtp://NCBS_USER@mail.ncbs.res.in&amp;quot; smtp_pass=&amp;quot;$NCBS_PASS&amp;quot; set realname=&amp;quot;$REAL_NAME&amp;quot; In short incoming server is imap.ncbs.res.in and outgoing server is mail.ncbs.res.in.

In the thesis, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are modeled by an electrical circuit generated from the equations arising from the Finite Element Method. This allows the solution of PDEs to be obtained through circuit simulation. One of the objectives of the thesis is to develop an efficient circuit simulator to solve circuits arising out of the electrical analogy for PDEs.</description></item><item><title>Easiest way (the command line way) to record your desktop (screencast) in linux</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-02-17-easiest-way-the-command-line-way-to-record-your-desktop-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-02-17-easiest-way-the-command-line-way-to-record-your-desktop-in-linux/</guid><description>Use this script.

There have been many instances of cheating in those courses; and my intention is to comment on it.</description></item><item><title>Mutt with gmail like labelling</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2012/2012-11-27-mutt-with-gmail-like-labelling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2012/2012-11-27-mutt-with-gmail-like-labelling/</guid><description>Finally, I stumbled upon something on how to manage labels in mutt.
