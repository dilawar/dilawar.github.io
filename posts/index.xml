It modifies the remote url and insert username and password (read from env) from it. No need to store ssh keys on remote server or git clone with https credentials.
For github.com repo, It looks for GITHUB_USER first, then for GIT_USER, and then USER environment variable. Similarly it looks for GITHUB_TOKEN, GIT_TOKEN for tokens. Fot gitlab.com repo, it looks for GITLAB_USER or GIT_USER or USER for username, and GITLAB_TOKEN, GIT_TOKEN for password.</description></item><item><title>Fixing 'cmake: symbol lookup error: cmake: undefined symbol: archive_write_add_filter_zst'</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2021/2021-07-02-fixing-cmake-symbol-lookup-error-cmake-undefined-symbol-archive_write_add_filter_zst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2021/2021-07-02-fixing-cmake-symbol-lookup-error-cmake-undefined-symbol-archive_write_add_filter_zst/</guid><description>I get the following error during build.

The standard way is numpy.save and numpy.load which works fine. My experience with opencv made me wonder if cv2.imwrite and cv2.imread can be used. The later saves the matrices to png file which works without any loss of data if you have 8 or 16 bit integer values in your matrices.</description></item><item><title>Convert webm file to WAV</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-12-13-convert-webm-file-to-wav/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-12-13-convert-webm-file-to-wav/</guid><description>Download the following script.

The buses emit more carbon and almost certain to carry many more passengers; same goes with trains. I could not find such numbers published for any Indian city. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that
A plane carries 100 passengers.</description></item><item><title>Humpty Dumpty</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-06-15-humpty-dumpty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-06-15-humpty-dumpty/</guid><description>Humpty Dumpty learned caution and care He climbed down the wall.

People are able to take finer personal distinctions in their businesses and other day-to-day work. In these societies, personal links can be used (or misused) for practically any purpose; and a certain sense of security is provided by the existence of such links. Now there are whole areas of life in complex industrial societies where such links are in principle irrelevant.</description></item><item><title>Comparision of various matplotlib/pylab plotting styles, version-1.(4, 5)</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-03-22-matplotlib-styles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2016/2016-03-22-matplotlib-styles/</guid><description>Global font size is set to 8 in all figures.

Factions are not limited to only political domain of our social life, they replicate themselves almost everywhere in similar forms.</description></item><item><title>Comfortable Chair</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-05-02-comfortable-chair/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-05-02-comfortable-chair/</guid><description>The old philosopher could never grasp.

More adventurous among them argued that it does not exists therefore anything which is labeled as secular can only be pseudo-secular.</description></item><item><title>Mail server info of National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS) Bangalore</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-09-04-mail-server-info-of-national-center-for-biological-sciences-ncbs-bangalore/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-09-04-mail-server-info-of-national-center-for-biological-sciences-ncbs-bangalore/</guid><description>If you are a mutt user and working at NCBS Bangalore, you can setup your account in mutt as following. set from=&amp;quot;REAL_NAME &amp;quot; set from=&amp;quot;USER NAME &amp;quot; set hostname=&amp;quot;imaps://imap.ncbs.res.in&amp;quot; set folder=&amp;quot;imaps://imap.ncbs.res.in&amp;quot; set record=&amp;quot;+INBOX.Sent&amp;quot; set imap_user=&amp;quot;NCBS_USER&amp;quot; set imap_pass=&amp;quot;NCBS_PASS&amp;quot; set postponed=&amp;quot;=Drafts&amp;quot; set spoolfile=&amp;quot;+INBOX&amp;quot; set signature=&amp;quot;sign.txt&amp;quot; set smtp_url=&amp;quot;smtp://NCBS_USER@mail.ncbs.res.in&amp;quot; smtp_pass=&amp;quot;$NCBS_PASS&amp;quot; set realname=&amp;quot;$REAL_NAME&amp;quot; In short incoming server is imap.ncbs.res.in and outgoing server is mail.ncbs.res.in.

His thesis was on &amp;ldquo;Solution of Network Coupled Partial Differential Equations Through Electrical Analogy&amp;rdquo;. Abstract of his thesis :
In the thesis, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are modeled by an electrical circuit generated from the equations arising from the Finite Element Method. This allows the solution of PDEs to be obtained through circuit simulation. One of the objectives of the thesis is to develop an efficient circuit simulator to solve circuits arising out of the electrical analogy for PDEs.</description></item><item><title>Easiest way (the command line way) to record your desktop (screencast) in linux</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-02-17-easiest-way-the-command-line-way-to-record-your-desktop-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-02-17-easiest-way-the-command-line-way-to-record-your-desktop-in-linux/</guid><description>Use this script.

It is said that cricket chauvinism runs across two axes, those of nation and generation. So when Steve Waugh came to the crease in the first test of the 1998-9 Ashes, A fellow countryman Bill Lawry welcomed him on television thus : &amp;lsquo;Here is the best batsman in the world&amp;rsquo;.

Any collection of these reasons echoes very tempting in my head (comparatively, pardon my set of ethics). Any profession which has low monetary return for relatively hard work generally acquire some sort of respect and dignity (also a sense of morality lingers. Look! I am doing this service and blah blah..). The perception of teaching, research, farming, nursing, social services etc are generally based on these rules only.</description></item><item><title>Seeking a career in a declining profession</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-05-19-seeking-a-career-in-a-declining-profession/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-05-19-seeking-a-career-in-a-declining-profession/</guid><description>Various reasons can be cited in public for choosing a profession. One expects if one has chosen a career, he or she puts a high value on it. Those who are not able to put a high value on what they do as profession usually feel like &amp;lsquo;wasting their life&amp;rsquo;. Karl Marx wondered why people act against their will when there is no apparent reason to do so. Sometime, one&amp;rsquo;s choice may not turn out to be a vocation and even after spending a lifetime; and one often looks for external symbols of success to overcome the feeling of failure.</description></item><item><title>Daadi and me ...</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-04-27-daadi-and-me/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-04-27-daadi-and-me/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;You call every old lady Dadi Ji, Tai Ji.

By any conservative measure, 70% of her population lives in her villages. My village Nichalpur is a small village. 782 people, 125 families - both nuclear and joint. It spreads out in the area of 6 acres. According to wikimapia tools , 105 Nichalpurs could fit in IIT Bombay campus easily. Nichalpur and three nearby villages constitute a panchayat in the name of Nichalpur.</description></item><item><title>The Most unlikely Villain : Jawahar Lal Nehru</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-04-04-the-most-unlikely-villain-jawahar-lal-nehru/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-04-04-the-most-unlikely-villain-jawahar-lal-nehru/</guid><description>It would not matter what kind of mess they made – and they would make a mess, if they governed themselves, the people of India.

HOSTEL 9
I stayed, all of my time during my post-graduation, in Hostel-9, Room No 133. In second year, masters student usually change their hostel to 12, 13 or 14. I did not like those big hostels. Hostel 9 is named &amp;lsquo;Pluto&amp;rsquo; which was stripped of its planetary designation in solar system when I was spending my time there.</description></item><item><title>Matka (M.

Honestly, I am not a supporter of competitions, even if I have been successful in one of them. The discomfort is for various reasons, most prominent of them is that competitions hardly add any social values. The boost in the confidence which I acquired came at the collective loss of confidence of the failed ones.</description></item><item><title>A brief History of Dilawar</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-03-02-a-brief-history-of-dilawar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-03-02-a-brief-history-of-dilawar/</guid><description>My ancestor were so happy living in Iran.
