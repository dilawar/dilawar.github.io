<h1 class=title>Overview of Faults in VLSI</h1>

<p>Someone who has access to market and someone who has access to capital came up
with an evil plan. They want to make a VLSI circuit and then they will
fabricate it and sell it to puny humans to make money [Evil laugh]. What they
want to create will surely depend on what their consumers will find useful. So
they hire someone who has expertise in consumer electronics and pays her to
figure out what they can sell to them with some good profit. After doing her
tricks, she gives them certain <strong><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document>product
requirements</a>.</strong>
Now these product requirements are sent to us - the engineers. We try very hard
to concentrate on them and after some time under the influence of burnt-out
neurons, we are able to draw up <strong><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04644754">specifications of VLSI
circuit</a>.</strong> These
specification usually describes the <a href=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhklenke/tutorials/vhdl/modules/m12_23/sld006.htm>behaviour of the circuit (e.g. in VHDL,
Verilog).</a>
Moreover, this specifications are embedded inside the model of the environment
in which this circuit suppose to work. For example, a chip designed to work
over Himalayas needs to be tested for temperature range -20 to -50 degree
centigrade, however if the targeted consumers are normal lesser mortals working
in their cozy rooms, these conditions of negative temperature can be relaxed or
dropped altogether. Now, my job starts. Based on these specifications, I have
to come up with a design. Depending on the level of my experiences and
expertise in design, I refine my design over the time mostly by trial and
error, and educated guesses. During all these trials, errors, and educated
guesses, I &rsquo;ll have my moment of genius which even I can not control.Â 
Normally, all these testing and designing are done with <a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/electric/>T-CAD
tools</a>. Ultimately I&rsquo;ll produce a
<a href=http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/><strong>layout</strong></a> of the circuit which is to be
manufactured. The layout then converted into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CBcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-micro.deis.unibo.it%2F~masetti%2FDida01%2FtecCMOS.pdf&ei=tcKMTPeQEcL98AbA1Nm2Cw&usg=AFQjCNE_uwbDnnSLEtz17dpKB0TF5ZeCxQ&sig2=rcBxcuCWfQ4df57MsPE0Vw">masks which are used to
fabricate</a>
this circuit in a fabrication facility.</p>
<h1 id=testing-verification-and-validation>Testing, Verification and Validation</h1>
<p>I do have trouble making distinction among these words but there are few things
which are different in them and are easy to see. Here, I define these terms as
defined by our Professor, <a href=http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/madhav>Madhav P.
Desai</a> during the course on
<em>Verification and Testing of VLSI Circuits</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>By testing, we normally refer to the process used to determine <strong>that the
manufactured circuit is functional</strong>. Every manufactured circuit needs to be
tested, and the result of the test should, with a <strong>high degree of
confidence</strong>, determine that the circuit is functional.</li>
<li>By verification, we normally refer to the process used to confirm that
<strong>refinements in the design process are consistent with the circuit
specification</strong>. For example, when a logic circuit is implemented using
transistors, we need to verify that the transistor network is equivalent to
the logic circuit which it is supposed to implement. This is done at each
refinement step in the design process.</li>
<li>By validation, we normally refer to the process used to confirm that a
functional manufactured <strong>circuit will fulfill the requirements</strong> to which it
was designed. This usually involves construction of a prototype and a test
setup which mimics reality to the <strong>maximum extent possible</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the fabrication, circuit must behave the way it was designed for, else we have failed as engineers. However, since no process is fault free, it could happen that the end product behave in unexpected ways. I like to think of it as <strong>this chip has developed a sense of humor.</strong> Now all these above mentioned processes can be utilized to remove this <strong>sense of humor</strong> out of the chip to make it behave in boring and rigid ways again. At the end of the day, it should work as it is told. <strong>Humor is the prerogative of Humans, machines must be humorless.</strong></p>
<h1 id=faults-in-vlsi>Faults in VLSI</h1>
<p>Faults in VLSI can occur due to various reasons. Most prominent among them is
due to flaws and variation fabrication processes (when engineer is competent).
These causes of faults are discussed in <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37888.37914">[Mally,
1987]</a>. Break in metal
lines, over and under deposition of material, alien particles in fabrication
process are the major sources of faults. As a designer, we need to test these
faults as early as possible. Later the fault is located, costlier it gets by an
order of magnitude (I do not have exact numbers here). Following figure 1 shows
a messed-up device fabricated by me with the help of lab-staff during my M.
Tech. Though it was useless for us then, it is useful for us for our present
discussion. [caption id=&ldquo;attachment_85&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo;

tacks.[/caption] Figure 2 shows the alien particles causing the short. Extra
deposition and less deposition of materials cause most of the shorts and open
circuits problem. Figure 3 shows the less deposition of material causing a
track to be less conductive. Any logic propagated through this track will be
weaker than the perfect track. Figure 4 shows that in spite of material
deposition was sufficient, part of the track may still come off due to less
adhesion between the deposited material and the substance. [caption

Figure 4 : SEM image shows that gold may not stick very well to the Si
substrate. Same thing can happen with other pairs of material.[/caption]

Figure 3 : Less materical deposition causing partial break in
track.[/caption] These faults, among others, are classified as spot defects.
Geometrically, these are randomly distributed over the entire fabrication area.
For more details on these faults we refer to <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37888.37914">[Mally,
1987]</a>. To summarize,</p>
<ul>
<li>Spot defects are regions of missing or extra material, (or drastically
changed with physical material characteristics) that may occur in any layer
of the fabricated IC.</li>
<li>These are expressed as number of defects per unit area. However, some defects
such as oxide pinholes and substrate dislocation can be expressed in density
only.</li>
<li>Cluster per unit area describes proneness of a region for defects.
Distribution of defect size is also a prominent fault-matrix component.</li>
<li>Short is generally caused by extra material deposition at a spot of missing
insulating material between two conductive tracks.</li>
<li>Break is generally caused by missing conductive material or extra insulating
material in insulating windows.</li>
<li>Shorts and breaks occur both in horizontal and vertical direction. Since
these days there are multi layer fabrication process are done in modern chip
fabrication. Vertical shorts and breaks are as important as the horizontal
one.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=fault-modeling>Fault Modeling</h1>
<h2 id=test-sequence-detectability>Test Sequence Detectability</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a gauge to measure how fault-free my circuit is. If I do a test, can
I answer this question. <strong>What are the chances that a successfully tested IC
still contains undetected faults? Such is measure which one can name <strong>test
sequence detectability,</strong> $latex D$</strong>.** It is defined as,</p>
<p>$D = \prod_{i=1}^{n_e}(1-{p_i})$</p>
<p>where, $p_i$ is the probability of the occurrence of faults andÂ  $latex
n_e$ are the faults that can not be detected by a given test sequence. Well,
defining it this make sense to me. If I can list out all the possible faults
that can occur in my circuit and their number is $latex n$. Let assume that
$latex n_f$ is the number of faults which I am testing my circuit for and letÂ 
$latex n_e$ are the faults which I can NOT detect during my test. Then,
$\frac{n_f-n_e}{n_f}$ represent traditional fault coverage and, of
course, $latex n > n_f$. Hence an ultimate fault model must list out all the
possible faults with their probability of occurrence. Practically, these faults
model are based on the experience of an Institute or company. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=784281&tag=1">[Birolini,
1994]</a>
gives details about fault occurrence in VLSI circuits. Some figures are given
below.</p>
<h1 id=stuck-at-models>Stuck at Models</h1>
<p>A traditional model is <strong>stuck at model</strong>. In this model, one prescribe to the
lines in the logic representation on the IC either state &lsquo;1&rsquo; or state &lsquo;0&rsquo; as
permanent state. TODO : Give a brief overview. Meanwhile readers can refer to a
book by Kohavi. Naturally, one uses probabilistic models while
studying them.</p>
