<p>Following table is an outcome of notes taken for sole purpose of generalising Left and Right politics. Left politics is usually confused with ideology of some political parties. Such views of politics in popular media are confusing if not contradictory. The distinction made between Left and Right was of French origin where the Left is called &ldquo;the party of movement&rdquo; and the Right &ldquo;the party of order&rdquo;. To be sure, there is no black-and-white distinction between these two political culture. It is often the case that a Right wing party takes a Leftist stand on one issue and a Left-wing party takes Rightist stand on another. However there are differences between these two culture which can not be denied.</p>
<p>In India, parenting and childcare is not perceived as something which can have socio-political colours. We include it here. In our media, the idea of politic is poorly debated. The popular belief - that &lsquo;politics is what a politician does&rsquo; - is widespread. It should not be surprising since the idea of &lsquo;politics&rsquo; is often confused with its Hindustani word &lsquo;Rajneeti&rsquo; (codes of ruling).</p>
