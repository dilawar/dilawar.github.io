<p>For a person without deep pockets, finding good quality electronic components
is a big challenge. There are usually two options: go to the likes of
<a href=https://digikey.in target=_blank>https://digikey.in</a> and <a href=https://mouser.in target=_blank>https://mouser.in</a> and spend quite a lot for a premium
quality, or go to your local electronic market and pray that the stuff you
bought has a decent quality. For hobbyist, early stage startup (like us), and
students, finding a vendor who can deliver a good compromise is very
challenging.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are some options. I’ve used following stores to buy
components especially boards, sensors and other kits. I am very happy with
their services. Both of them did prompt deliveries.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://robu.in target=_blank>robu.in</a></li>
<li><a href=https://evelta.com target=_blank>evelta</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily find popular boards, kits and general purpose sensors. At the
time of writing, robu has a larger inventory but evelta has some newer
cutting-edge boards. In fact, after going through their inventories, we
replaced ST boards with a ReSpeaker board for prototyping since the ecosystem
around ReSpeaker board is open-source and easy to start with. Getting started
with a st-board was relatively hard (theirs docs are still in PDF!!)</p>
<p>Both of these stores have ticketing systems for support. Most Indian shops are
yet to learn a lot about customer support. I’ve not yet used evelta support but
I’ve had queries for robu about available products. Robu was responsive. All in
all, happy to see that local ecosystem is getting better. Best wishes to both
of them!</p>
