<p>I often try to remember how much each mode of transportation costs the environment. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TAMZLvUrMlxAR4RdDOs928-yoU5RxMrDKIb8tXuOKsc/edit?hl=en_GB&hl=en_GB#gid=0" target=_blank>Data published by UK government</a> has good numbers. These data can probably be used as proxy for India with some caveats. The buses emit more carbon and almost certain to carry many more passengers; same goes with trains. I could not find such numbers published for any Indian city. Let&rsquo;s assume that</p>
<ul>
<li>A plane carries 100 passengers.</li>
<li>A train carries 1000 passengers.</li>
<li>A car carries 4 passengers.</li>
<li>A bus carries 100 passengers.</li>
<li>A bike carries 2 passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following is the value of cost per person per kilometer (roughly, rounded up for easy to remember). <strong>1 flight = 10 cars = 20 bikes = 50 bus = 100 Trains!</strong> It means, &ldquo;If you travel in a fully occupied flight for a kilometer, it costs environment equal to 10 car kilometers (with 3 co-passengers), 20 bike kilometers (with 1 co-passengers), 50 bus kilometers (with 99 co-passengers), and 100 (diesel) train kilometers (with 999 co-passengers). The most environment-friendly mode of traveling is train. Bus is good choice for inter-city travel. If cars are fully occupied, they are as costly to environment as a bike. Cycling is the best!</p>
