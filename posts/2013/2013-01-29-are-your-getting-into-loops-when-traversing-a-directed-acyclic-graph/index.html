<p>How to detect if you are getting caught inside a loop when you are traversing a directed graph. This is equivalent of checking if you graph is a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph title="Directed acyclic graph">Directed Acyclic Graph</a> (DAG). Assume that each vertex of graph has a label such as A, B, C, etc. While you are traversing the graph, you keep your labels of traversed vertices on a stack or in a vector. If you construct a string out of this traversal, you will get a pattern like the following one.</p>
<p>A,B,D,E,F,D,E,F,D,E,F</p>
<p>Whenever you are caught in a loop, a path will repeat itself. We have D,E,F repeating itself. Now there are two ways to detect this. One is a classical graph based method which is efficient $latex O(E+V)$. The second one, about which I am going to talk about now, is not as efficient as first but but it is very easy to code. It is based on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression title="Regular expression">regular expressions</a>. All we have to do is Â construct a string out of the data-structure which holds the vertex traversal order and match it against a regular-pattern which looks for the repeated substrings. Here is one such pattern written using boost regex library.</p>
<p>boost::regex rx ("^([0-9a-zA-Z_@]+,)+(?[0-9a-zA-Z@_,]+)(g{cycle})$", boost::regex::perl);</p>
<p>Care has to be taken while using this regex. First, I have special character @ in the label of vertex. And this pattern assumes that if there is a single repetition such as A,B,A,B or A,B,B etc, then it must lead to a loop. In my case it is justified. You should think if this is the behavior you want. And again, it is not as efficient as standard graph algorithms to detect loop (which uses <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search title="Depth-first search">Depth First Search</a>). But for writing quick tests, it is a good approach. I have used boost regex library. I am already using boost graph library therefore I need not look for other libraries. I have heard a some good things about GNU-regex library but have never used myself. Also, my gcc (4.6) does not support 2011C++ fully e.g. regex is not implemented fully. Have a look at its status page before writing any regex using header . &ndash; Dilawar</p>
