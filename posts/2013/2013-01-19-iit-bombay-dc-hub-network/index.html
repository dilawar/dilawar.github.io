<p><em>Most likely all of the links mentioned on hub-list page are now dead.</em> If there are lot of enlightened (and pervert) users over LAN then there would definitely be some Direct Connection (DC) hubs. And IIT Bombay is no exception. DC-hubs are maintained by undergraduate students. They download and share most of the data. I am greatly thankful to them for sharing latest animated movies etc. They have the enthusiasm and energy of young. There is no fixed IP scheme for these hubs. When a new hub is created, it is usually assigned a new ip-address according to the whims of its creator. Therefore, there are no standard addressing scheme for hubs besides 10.<em>.</em>.*. The digit which follows the 10 is usually hostel number, but I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it. <a href=http://www.tinyurl.com/iitbdchubs target=_blank>This link</a> claims to maintain currently active hubs. I have also started keeping ips of hub-list. See this <a href=https://github.com/dilawar/MyPublic/blob/master/OpenDC/hublist.txt target=_blank>page for hub-list</a>. To browse these hubs, one usesÂ  open-dc clients. For windows, there are many such applications as opendc, dcplusplus etc (ask your neighbor.). For Linux users, at least following applications are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>linuxdcpp - Sometimes this application hangs, slows down the system and refuses to start. But works well most the of the time. It&rsquo;s been around for a long time on Linux. Available in Ubuntu repositories.</li>
<li>valknut - User-interface is not great but it is lightweight and never hangs. Available in Ubuntu repositories. A great tool indeed. I will not slow down your system. Downside, not a great user interface.</li>
<li><a href=http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/ target=_blank>Eisalktdcpp</a> - It is under-development and cross platform. It slows down the system significantly but it has many features e.g. scripting. Available in Ubuntu repositories. <strong>UPDATE</strong> It is working fine now on my Ubuntu machine. I have been using it for two-months and have given up the idea of modifying microdc2 for personal use. Eisalktdcpp is great and perhaps the best-bet around. You can also enable spy-mode to see what people are searching.</li>
<li>microdc2 - For command line junkies. You can get a fork from <a href=https://github.com/dilawar/microdc2 target=_blank>my github</a>. Irritating user-status are not printed in console in this fork. Also available in official Ubuntu repositories.</li>
</ul>
