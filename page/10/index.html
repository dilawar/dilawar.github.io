Still enjoying success in GATE? Well, it&rsquo;s a good time now to come out of your shell and start preparing yourself for some engineering work before your success do some permanent damage to you. GATE (or any examination) tests theoretical knowledge and has little to do with skills. I have had some classmates who could not even compile a program and had great percentile in GATE. Mere theoretical knowledge is not a replacement of real engineering skills.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Calculating maximum flow in a flow-network is a fundamental problem. It has been observed that smart implementation of &lsquo;push-relabel&rsquo; methods performs better than algorithms based on finding &lsquo;augmenting paths&rsquo;. We have implemented one such variation of push-relabel method. It is known as &lsquo;relabel to front&rsquo; algorithm. It is discussed in details in &lsquo;Introduction to algorithms&rsquo; by &lsquo;Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein&rsquo;. We do not guarantee that it is the exact implementation of what is given in this book.&mldr;

[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_934&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;462&rdquo;] One of the t-shirts designed by IITians at IIT Bombay. To some extent, the process of t-shirt design is democratic. Designs can be submitted by anyone and few are chosen (perhaps by voting). Since a lot of IITians are involved in t-shirt designing, these are good candidates for studying the nature of IITians. This t-shirt belongs to Electrical Engineering department and says &lsquo;not for everyone&rsquo; signifying either the exclusivity of IITians or the superiority of Electrical Engineering department over other departments.&mldr;

<span class=description>
One of our group member has successfully defended his Ph.D.. His thesis was on &ldquo;Solution of Network Coupled Partial Differential Equations Through Electrical Analogy&rdquo;. Abstract of his thesis :
In the thesis, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are modeled by an electrical circuit generated from the equations arising from the Finite Element Method. This allows the solution of PDEs to be obtained through circuit simulation. One of the objectives of the thesis is to develop an efficient circuit simulator to solve circuits arising out of the electrical analogy for PDEs.&mldr;

Use this script. Make sure ~/Video directory exits on your computer. And ffmpeg is also installed. This script computes the resolution of your desktop and saves the video to ~/Video/output.mkv file. The file size is typically very big (high definition) which you can again reduce to by converting the file to some other format using ffmpeg. No need to use GUI application.

Someone suggested that if you have seahorse installed, remove it. (I did, but it did not work) Someone suggested that exporting PINENTRY_USER_DATA=&ldquo;USE_CURSES=1&rdquo; will do the trick. It also did not work. **Add --no-use-agent to the command option. It worked with old version of gpg. No gui is appeared while decrypting the file.
This does not work with gpg2. Program gpg2 needs a use-agent. You have to create a file ~/.&mldr;

लो अतीत से उतना ही जितना पोषक है जीर्ण-शीर्ण का मोह मृत्यु का ही द्योतक है तोड़ो बन्धन, रुके न चिंतन गति, जीवन का सत्य चिरन्तन धारा के शाश्वत प्रवाह में इतने गतिमय बनो कि जितना परिवर्तन है। &ndash; Dwarika Prasad Maheshwari
One of our historians has noted, rather ruefully, the lack of taste for accurate historical writing. &lsquo;India, for its great literary heritage&rsquo;, wrote D. D. Kosambi, &lsquo;has produced no historical writers comparable to Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy, Tacitus&rsquo;.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Our newspapers are filled with articles and news-reports where all sorts of accusations and allegations can be found. People in India, like people in many other countries, were not any less enthusiastic in the past for lashing out at their politicians, bureaucrats or any public-office holder but the style and content of this activity has been changed greatly by Internet and media. It is more common these days to find people accusing not only public figures but also their colleagues for some wrong or corrupt conduct.&mldr;

<span class=description>
How to detect if you are getting caught inside a loop when you are traversing a directed graph. This is equivalent of checking if you graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Assume that each vertex of graph has a label such as A, B, C, etc. While you are traversing the graph, you keep your labels of traversed vertices on a stack or in a vector. If you construct a string out of this traversal, you will get a pattern like the following one.&mldr;
