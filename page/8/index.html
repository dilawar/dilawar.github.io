<span class=description>
The mind of a man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass, wherein the beam of things should reflect according to their true incidence: nay, it is rather like a enchanted glass, full of superstition and imposture. &ndash; Francis Beacon
Prof. Andre Beteille &ndash; whom I owe a great deal of intellectual debt &ndash; wrote once that the aim of intellectual pursuit is to scratch the surface of confusion caused by experience and observation.&mldr;

<span class=description>
If I were to be forced to replace my mutt with some other general purpose email client I&rsquo;d prefer thunderbird with plugin muttator.
If you prefer easy to setup and click-based tools then you will not find mutt very exciting, however those who loves to split hair and tweak their tools to their whims will find much in mutt to please them. Learning the full power of mutt takes time and some sort of persistence.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2013/2013-12-26-charisma-in-democracy/>Do we really need 'strong' leaders?</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
The media coverage of the death of Nelson Mandela and retirement of Sachin Tendulkar brought back the memory of an old essay written &lsquo;on charisma&rsquo; by German sociologist Max Weber. I asked a German colleague how many charismatic personalities he knows in politics in his country. He responded somewhat indirectly, &ldquo;There are some, but usually in Germany parties are more important than individuals.&rdquo; When I hinted at Hitler, he said that Hitler played a great part in forming a distaste of &lsquo;charismatic&rsquo; people.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a lightweight application. It hardly takes any cpu. Moreover it runs in background and does not clutter and workspace. If you dont use mouse frequently or wants to avoid it (programmers use keyboard), then mpd is for you. It is one of those applications which does one job at a time and does it really well (well, if you get is working once which is not very hard).&mldr;

<span class=description>
Cheating is quite prevalent in Indian universities and IITs are no exception but they are very reluctant to admit it in open. Apparently it brings bad name to the institute. In this note, I dont want to discuss the social issues as I have done is somewhere else. As a teaching assistant, I wrote an application which sniff codes submitted by students. And here is some data. Students were aware, more or less, that such tool exists.&mldr;

Andrea: Unhappy is the land that breeds no hero. Galileo: No, Andrea: Unhappy is the land that needs a hero. &ndash; Life of Galilio, Bertolt Brecht
The French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville, a great observer of man&rsquo;s affairs, while witnessing the birth of democracy in America, thought that the age of democracy will be the age of mediocrity. There will be a dead level plane of achievement in almost every kind of activity.&mldr;

code{white-space: pre;}
Currently I am spending a year in NCBS Bangalore. I like to experiment with Operating Systems (OS). Needless to say, I download them often. And they can be pretty big (>500 Mb usually). In NCBS, speed is often poor but there is a catch. Speed over FTP is much better (upto 1 mb per sec) than it is over http (upto 100K per sec). Not all FTP servers are fast enough, some are pretty bad.&mldr;

<span class=description>
As for the word race, it has so many different meanings, as to be useless in scientific discussion, to very useful for getting members of the same nation to hate one another. &ndash; JBS Haldane
A resolution passed recently by European Parliament recognizing caste-based discrimination as a form of racial discrimination reminds one of an article written by the social anthropologist Andre Beteille about a decade ago. Beteille described a similar attempt by U.&mldr;

<span class=description>
During the development of neural circuits, excessive synapses are formed in a genetically programmed manner. Neural circuits are refined by the experience dependent pruning of supernumerary imprecise connections and the strengthening of the functional synapses. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. In [1], authors describe the role of ephrin-A2 in regulating experience dependent, NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic pruning through glial glutamate transport during maturation of the mouse cortex.&mldr;
