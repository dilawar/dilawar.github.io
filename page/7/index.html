<span class=description>
The old philosopher could never grasp. The secret of Happiness. Morality and cynicism confuse. Confusion blinds, undependable eyes. Man ponders over imponderables, Who am I? Purpose of Life? Vexed soul, uneased mind. Sigh, sigh, sigh! The secret of Happiness, My friend. Is to find a comfortable chair. And grippped by the feeling That universe is full of benign air.&mldr;

<span class=description>
The speed of action potentials inside neurons is comparable to those of motorized two wheelers. The slowest of action potential lies in the range of 30-40 Km/hr while the fastest one is in the range of 400-500 Km/hr. The faster neurons are most likely to be mylienated. This cool figure from Wiki depicts the propagation speed of action potential.

<span class=description>
Some twelve inches below my lips The Human of my Person lives. It melts for strangers with meaningless smile. And indifferent to most other kind. Beware, O Stranger! Rudely crossing it. I have no gun, but I can spit. (Inspired by a poem &ldquo;I have not gun but I can spit&rdquo; by W H Auden).&mldr;

<span class=description>
I took my Master of Technology in Microelectronics and VLSI in Teaching Assistant category (2007-2009) from IIT Bombay. Although project work is an essential part of this program, it is more or less a taught degree. One does a certain minimum amount of course work in first two semesters and expected to contribute to a project along with course work. First two semesters prepare students for doing the project, to which the student suppose to contribute in final two semesters.&mldr;

<span class=description>
One of my lab-mates hikes to psychologically anneal himself. May be hiking is some sort of spiritual experience for him as doing assignments is for me. He planned for a night hiking around Antergange. Oliver told me that we&rsquo;d pass through some villages during trekking, I enthusiastically joined them. Also I like the company of a girl who promised to joined us. We started from NCBS Bagalore around 4pm and reached Majestic bus station around 5pm and took a bus to Kolar from Terminal 3, platform 8.&mldr;

<span class=description>
It is not uncommon these days many Indians showing strong concern &ndash; at least on public occasions &ndash; about the shoddy state of affairs in which we find our higher education today. It will be an understatement to say that everything is not fine with our higher education system. The rot has gone really deep, and in some sense it is equivalent to our record in primary education which is nothing if not a scandal.&mldr;

<span class=description>
The rigor and enthusiasm with which economists have been advising government - and incidentally maligning each other - have naturally led some to reflect on the role of intellectuals in society. The role of social scientists have enlarged to a great extent in this world and they have come to play some sort of pre-eminent role in public policies and debates. At least in India, most if not all social scientists regard their discipline something more than just an intellectual pursuit.&mldr;

<span class=description>
This article is written by Prof. S. D. Agashe. I greatly enjoyed it when I was a master student.
Euclidean geometry and the axiomatic method Euclid’s Elements constitutes the earliest extant substantial presentation of a body of material in the axiomatico-deductive form . Through it the subject of geometry got permanently associated with axiomatico-deductive formulation which was then viewed as a method, so much so that the expression ‘more geometrico’ (the geometric way) became synonymous with axiomatico-deductive formulation.&mldr;
