We are becoming lazy people, especially with our hands and feet and often enough; intellectually lazy too.

Boredom is the worst evil in Human life and work banishes three great evils : boredom, vice and poverty.

Today I found a rather peculiar email in my inbox. It was sent to IITB general mailing list, meant for notification about events on the campus. This email was written for anyone &lsquo;who is concerned with IIT Bombay future&rsquo;. Thus I read it. The sender is a member of student body. He was disappointed with the little interests shown by IIT Bombay student community for the debate on new single entrance examination proposed of Government of India.&mldr;

For last few decades, many scholars of Indian history have started to argue, sometimes with official patronage, that Indus civilization was not only Aryan, but also Vedic or even post-Vedic. To make their view credible they tried to prove, among other things, that the &lsquo;Rigveda&rsquo; was composed around 3500 BC, a date contemporaneous to with the Indus civilization. Their opponents claim that these proponents usually reject the entire method of dating by linguistics comparisons.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Those who know how cricket grew in India will agree that community pride was the major force behind the promotion of this game. Cricket had a very large following in India, even before independence. It had influenced Indian politics to a much larger extent than Indian historian have written about it. Cricket came to India with British who played it to amuse themselves in an alien land. An acute observer of British ways, Nirad Chaudhary, once remarked that to Englishman abroad, literature was his wife and sport his mistress.&mldr;

I am not of the view that most of us join an educational institute for the sake of knowledge. I also find it unconvincing that an educational institute is build solely for the purpose of &lsquo;spreading knowledge&rsquo;; no matter what their motto is. There will be few among us who are driven solely by the desire of learning, criticizing existing and producing new knowledge. For rest of us there are certain benefits to be harnessed; employment and social status being the most prominent one.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Perhaps it is due to incapabilities of human mind in handling more than 5 or 6 details at a time that abstraction is born. Now there a tendency to glorify abstraction by which one squeeze details into a small representable quantity. No doubt abstraction is useful. It definitely make sense to write down eigen values of a big matrix or a huge graph and pass comment on them. But should we made &lsquo;the ultimate abstract&rsquo; as the holy grail of intellectualism?&mldr;

What good is happiness if it cannot buy you money!
 – Attributed to Zsa Zsa Gabor
In 2008, New Scientists, summarized the results of a survey covering 65 nations to show the largest proportion of happy people lived in, of all places, in Nigeria, followed by Mexico, Venezuela, El Salvador and Puerto Rico. Last year, some other survey identified Bangladesh as the happiest country in the world, and perhaps a year or two before that, it was Vanuatu (heard the name before?&mldr;
