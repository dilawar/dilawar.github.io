<a class=title href=/posts/2010/2010-07-17-natural-numbers/>Natural Numbers : Definition</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
How to use natural numbers? That is very easy. We&rsquo;ve all learned how to use natural numbers in school. But it is hard to answer; &ldquo;How to define natural numbers?&rdquo;. And harder would be; &ldquo;How to define the actions we do on natural numbers such as multiplication or addition?&rdquo; Terrence Tao has discussed these issues beautifully in his book and I recommend that one should get this book and read Chapter 2 and 3 [1].&mldr;

&lsquo;Game theory&rsquo; has it&rsquo;s most unforgiving situation known as &lsquo;grim&rsquo;. If two parties A and B are dealing with each other under some norms and if one of them breaks these norms then other once can accept &lsquo;grim&rsquo; i.e. B will never do business with A again or vice versa. This is very much established that &lsquo;trust&rsquo; is the prime factor among the individuals and organizations which enables them to do business together smoothly.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Reasons to do a Ph.D. could be at most four or five. Any collection of these reasons echoes very tempting in my head (comparatively, pardon my set of ethics). Any profession which has low monetary return for relatively hard work generally acquire some sort of respect and dignity (also a sense of morality lingers. Look! I am doing this service and blah blah..). The perception of teaching, research, farming, nursing, social services etc are generally based on these rules only.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Various reasons can be cited in public for choosing a profession. One expects if one has chosen a career, he or she puts a high value on it. Those who are not able to put a high value on what they do as profession usually feel like &lsquo;wasting their life&rsquo;. Karl Marx wondered why people act against their will when there is no apparent reason to do so. Sometime, one&rsquo;s choice may not turn out to be a vocation and even after spending a lifetime; and one often looks for external symbols of success to overcome the feeling of failure.&mldr;

<span class=description>
&ldquo;You call every old lady Dadi Ji, Tai Ji. But why don&rsquo;t you call your own dadi, Dadi ji. All the time you call her Buddhiya (old woman)?&rdquo;, Papa used to scold me. So when he was around, I&rsquo;d call my grandmother, Dadi - still not Dadi Ji. Calling her Dadi Ji was too much. These benign respectful words are for outsiders. She is a friend, very fast friend. When Papa was not around, I&rsquo;d simply say &ldquo;Oye Buddhi&mldr; ki haal chal&mldr;?&mldr;

<span class=description>
India, a land of ironies, is a land of villages. By any conservative measure, 70% of her population lives in her villages. My village Nichalpur is a small village. 782 people, 125 families - both nuclear and joint. It spreads out in the area of 6 acres. According to wikimapia tools , 105 Nichalpurs could fit in IIT Bombay campus easily. Nichalpur and three nearby villages constitute a panchayat in the name of Nichalpur.&mldr;

It would not matter what kind of mess they made – and they would make a mess, if they governed themselves, the people of India. They would probably make the greatest muddle possible. &ndash; D. H. Lawrence, Aaron&rsquo;s Rod My legacy to India? Hopefully, it is 400 million people capable of governing themselves. &ndash; Jawaharlal Nehru
Different people hate him for different reasons. Not only these reasons are the outcome of hindsight, they are also mutually contradictory.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Nichalpur is a small village. It has a primary school. All of the nearby three villages had only one school that time. Just like everyone else in my village, from class 1 to class 5, I did my primary schooling there.
COME, GET A DOB :
&lsquo;When was I born?&rsquo;, I did not know till I was 21. My mother could tell me that I was born on the day of Holi.&mldr;

I was a M.Tech (Matka) in IIT Bombay during 2007-2009. These are few accounts of this life.
HOSTEL 9
I stayed, all of my time during my post-graduation, in Hostel-9, Room No 133. In second year, masters student usually change their hostel to 12, 13 or 14. I did not like those big hostels. Hostel 9 is named &lsquo;Pluto&rsquo; which was stripped of its planetary designation in solar system when I was spending my time there.&mldr;

<span class=description>
After passing through A, B, C, D kind of exams (GATE 2007), I applied at IISc (Dept of Instrumentation), IITM (Dept of Aerospace) and IIT Kanpur (Nuclear Technology). Honestly, I am not a supporter of competitions, even if I have been successful in one of them. The discomfort is for various reasons, most prominent of them is that competitions hardly add any social values. The boost in the confidence which I acquired came at the collective loss of confidence of the failed ones.&mldr;
