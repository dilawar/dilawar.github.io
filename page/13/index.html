Following function split a string into a list of strings at a given string. For example split &ldquo;dilawar raw war&rdquo; &ldquo;aw&rdquo; returns [&ldquo;dil&rdquo;, &ldquo;ar r&rdquo; " war"]
split :: String -> String -> [String] split str pat = helper str pat [] [] where helper :: String -> String -> String -> String -> [String] helper [] ys n m = [n] ++ [] helper xs [] n m = [n] ++ (split xs pat) helper (x:xs) (y:ys) n m | x /= y = helper (xs) pat ((n++m)++[x]) m | otherwise = helper xs ys n (m++[y])&mldr;

I am interested in greatness, not in damn dots.
-- John Arlott, writing on W. G. Grace
It is said that cricket chauvinism runs across two axes, those of nation and generation. So when Steve Waugh came to the crease in the first test of the 1998-9 Ashes, A fellow countryman Bill Lawry welcomed him on television thus : &lsquo;Here is the best batsman in the world&rsquo;. Waugh himself quickly disavowed this title given by a fellow countryman.&mldr;

<span class=description>
&lsquo;The Pariah dog&rsquo;, wrote an acute observer of Indian ways, &lsquo;has always been on downhill slope of popular contempt&rsquo;. Natives ignore his &lsquo;novel potentialities of his characters&rsquo; and discourage him by &lsquo;keeping him at a distance&rsquo;. He is denied affection to which its British counterpart has a social claim. The Pariah dog longs for a master; a mere approving look touches a chord is it heart. Compared with English dog, says Kipling, &lsquo;the poor Indian outcast is a pagan, a creature without faith, or at least without that soul-saving reverence for authority which ennobles character&rsquo; and concluded rightly that &lsquo;the Pariah does not know the joy of adoration&rsquo; for he has no master.&mldr;

<span class=description>
It looks promising and cool. Snakes is a Python library for working with Petri-nets. I am playing around with it so can&rsquo;t say much about it right now. Here is some blogs about it by its author. It is hosted on google-code. A long list of petri-nets related tools is available here. Some of them are no longer active or dead or both.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2012/2012-03-05-checking-plagiarism-in-students-code/>Checking plagiarism in assignment (tested with VHDL language)</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
I have developed some python scripts available here. I have used them in EE705 (VHDL, verilog) and found them very useful. It generates detailed log (which file matches which file) and sent emails to offenders with an archive of all file which were matched. It is integrated with my moodle-application (automatic download, extract, compare, sending-emails.) It also generates graphs (using python graph-tool) which shows the level of copying in the assignments.&mldr;

<span class=description>
UPDATE : There are two version of this script. Output of both is same but they work on different version of moodle. This script (with configuration file available inside the repo) should work with new moodle while this one (with this configuration) should work with old moodle. Downloading each student&rsquo;s assignment from moodle could be a real pain. I&rsquo;ve updated my old scripts which download assignments from Moodle and stores each student&rsquo;s assignment in a separate directory named after student.&mldr;

I have written this program which tests LEDA library performance for shortest path algorithm performance. This library is pretty good. Much easier to use than boost libraries.

<a class=title href=/posts/2011/2011-12-01-langford-pairs-in-haskell/>Langford pairs in Haskell</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
\This implementation is not-very naive but it is not very efficient either. It can generate solutions up to n = 12, then it gets very slow.
This is an extremely horrible solution to generate langford pairs by dilawar@ee.iitb.ac.in succesfully finished on Nov 27, 2011 after two days of labour. Is is advised not to use this program in any real-time application. Its runs slower than Chacha Chaudary brain. One can achieve much better performace by using Arrays in Haskell.&mldr;

<span class=description>
It&rsquo;s a dreadful pity when a beautifully spacious generalisation is upset by one or two simple facts.
-- Neville Cardus
The doyen of Indian anthropology M. N. Srivinas said that an anthropologist is born thrice. He is &lsquo;once-born&rsquo; when he initially goes to the field, away from his familiar surroundings to put himself in a world of which he has little clue. He is &lsquo;twice-born&rsquo; when, on living for some time among his chosen tribe, he is able to see things from their view-point.&mldr;
