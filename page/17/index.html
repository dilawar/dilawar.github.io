<span class=description>
Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering is designed to test your basics in engineering. It has nothing to do with experiences in industries. By engineering basics, I mean your core courses. You must know them. I was bit troubled with all these mushrooming of GATE coaching centres on the line of JEE and the way they &lsquo;buy&rsquo; opinion to suit their business, so I am writing this.
I am pretty sure that one can succeed in exams without using these centre.&mldr;

<span class=description>
If your getmail is giving multiple copies of messages are each run, then do this in your configuration file in ~/.getmail/ directory.
[options] verbose = 0 read_all = false delete = true message_log = ~/.getmail/log
read_all
is by default True. You need to set it false else it will create many copies of same message and will make your life miserable.&mldr;

The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry, prophecy and religion, all in one.
-- John Ruskin
Every generation have its heroes, dead and alive. The dead are discovered by writing they left behind.&mldr;

Russian President Dimitry Medvedev visited IIT Bombay on Dec 22, 2010 (Thanks to Mr. Anonymous for correcting the date). Russian contribution in establishing IIT Bombay was tremendous. You can measure their contribution by noting that on our website &lsquo;history of IIT Bombay&rsquo; page acknowledges it in six lines out of total ten lines written about IIT-B history. 60% by line numbers and since these 6 lines are longer, their contribution become larger if one take &lsquo;words&rsquo; written about it as a unit.&mldr;

I have collected information regarding latest progress made in solving of system of Linear Equations. Interestingly this works uses spanning tree (approximate) in solving Linear Equations. Its was amazing that tree has to do anything with system of linear equations . See the attached beamer. Apparently they claim that they have found the fastest algorithm. In nutshell, they combined support theory with conjugate gradient methods. A lot of mathematicians work has been an integral part of this progress.&mldr;

<span class=description>
As the VLSI memories are shrinking in their size, the density of cells which holds data is increasing exponentially. If one is making a living out of manufacturing them then he must make sure product he is releasing in the market is fault free. So he must hire some trained person to test memories of how much they are faulty. I wish I could do that with my natural memory .&mldr;

[in progress : I&rsquo;ll put up the solution after Nov 28. I have to submit it as assignment so can not take the risk of being copied or so.] These days simulation is the most prominent technique for verification. However, simulation can only cover a part of all cases possible thus simulation does not guarantee that certain properties will hold everywhere in the system. For example, any complex asynchronous boolean circuit with 100 variables will have 2100 combination.&mldr;

Given a VLSI entity and its two description, establishing if both of them are equivalent is fundamental problem in VLSI verification. In this post, I am going to give describe an small part of this problem. Lets say someone has provided us with an behavioral description of an entity. For example lets say the given behavior of this entity is following. [caption id=&ldquo;attachment_255&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;326&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;a, b, c, and d are input to this entity and e is output.&mldr;

Path breaking inventions in any country were the priviledge of ametuer apprentices rather than artisans who followed the profession traditionally and carried forward the technology mechanically.
 &ndash; Shankar Abaji Bhise
How should I justify title of this blog when every Indian is a born engineers. Go to any Village, you&rsquo;ll see them inventing ingenious solutions to their problems all the time. This discipline, known as jugaad (makeshift) is a way too Indian.&mldr;

What you can rightly say about India, its opposite is also equally true.
-- A teacher of Amartya Sen
&ldquo;South India has counted for too little in the Indian Republic. This is a waste for India as well as an unfairness to south India, because the south has a superiority in certain important things—its relative lack of violence, its lack of anti-Muslim intolerance, its lack of indiscipline and delinquency in the universities; in its better educational standards, its better government, and its cleanliness; in its far lesser practice of corruption and its little taste for Hindu revivalism.&mldr;
