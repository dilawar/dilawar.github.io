Take Boolean Algebra with two elements $latex (0, 1)$ for instance, the underlying finite field $latex 0,1,\{.,+\}$ is equivalent to $latex 0,1,\{NAND\}$ or $latex 0,1,\{NOR\}$ where NAND and NOR are considered as universal gates. This means that instead of defining two operations $latex (+, .) $, I can work with either NAND or NOR and all things will fall in places. Is this property, which is true in 2 elements field, that $latex .&mldr;

I do not like grading others, its time-consuming and unreasonable. It is not good to see anyone losing his confidence because of doing poorly in some examination. But I do not see any other way to make a merit list. Merit is very necessary evil for an institute to function. One has to discriminate in one sense or another. I am not claiming that I can be &lsquo;fair&rsquo; to everyone. No one is supposed to make decisions which are acceptable to all but it is no excuse of making incompetent judgments.&mldr;

Enjoying fame and keeping an independent mind is not something one can expect from anyone. Fame is a double-edge sword. one feel tempted to do whatever one&rsquo;s admirers want, and admirers are possessed with the one being admired. It creates a loop with &lsquo;positive feedback&rsquo;; and &lsquo;positive feedback&rsquo; is known do nasty thing to a system, especially to its stability. It is far from my intention to build a &lsquo;system theory&rsquo; for these kind of social behavior.&mldr;

In this blog, we explore primitive mathematical properties of of love. Here we are only concerned with love between male and females. Among other things, we shall show that concept of &lsquo;love triangle&rsquo; is a myth unless one allows homosexuality.MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIESLet $latex \mathbb{H}$ be the set of all humans. Let $latex \mathbb{M} \subset \mathbb{H}$ is the set of all lovable Males (definition?) and let $latex \mathbb{F} \subset \mathbb{H}$ be the set of all lovable females .&mldr;

When I posted mine and other teaching assistant&rsquo;s mobile numbers on IITB Moodle and mentioned that my number has two prime factor, in case you wants to verify; and others should be right since I copy and pasted them, Srihari replied back,
Sunny got 3 prime factors and you 2 as you said..while achin had 6..
now i started to wonder how many prime factors on avg for 10 digit telephone number (starting with 9).&mldr;

The trouble with spending time on a &lsquo;good university&rsquo; (or having educated parents) is that it might make you incapable of thinking about certain ideas. If you are a historian trained in Harvard University, than like New York Times, you may not be able to think beyond the nations of Atlantis. An economist, who have spend a fair amount of his/her time in &lsquo;Chicago-Stockholm Express&rsquo; can not digest the criticism of &lsquo;free-market&rsquo;.&mldr;

<span class=description>
According to these pages http://jeff560.tripod.com the word &lsquo;pole&rsquo; was first used in Théorie des fonctions elliptiques. English translation (of course using google), &ldquo;When u is holomorphic function in a certain part of the plan, except at a point z1, where it becomes infinite, so however that the function remains 1/u holomorphic in the neighborhood of this point, we say that this is a pole or infinite the function u.&rdquo; In their memoirs they have mentioned that pole is &lsquo;un infini du degré fini&rsquo;- An infinity of finite degree.&mldr;

Draft.
If you are born in an Indian village - at least the one in which I was born - you can be sure of two things; one, you will not know your date of birth (according to global calender even though it is mostly used) and second, you will never be known by your given name. These two social construct of &lsquo;puranic&rsquo; proportion can only be belied should you survive the basic schooling and somehow jump into the bandwagon named education.&mldr;

Hello, terminal lovers. There are many other blogs written about &lsquo;mutt&rsquo; and &lsquo;getmail&rsquo;. Surely you can take hints from any of them. This post is written for IIT Bombay email servers. You pathetic Windows guys, piss off!!
Get Emails from Server First of all, we need to use &lsquo;something&rsquo; to fetch emails from gpo server. Mutt can be used to read directly from server. But I like storing my emails on my machine.&mldr;
