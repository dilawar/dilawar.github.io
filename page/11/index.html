<a class=title href=/posts/2013/2013-01-27-in-praise-of-secularism/>In praise of : Secularism</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
A growing tendency in India is to attack secularism, covertly and indirectly. The attack on secularism is somewhat similar to the attack on equality. They maintain since we can not define secularism (like equality) in a strict sense, it will be good if we stop using the term altogether, at least to avoid the intellectual confusion. More adventurous among them will go on to say that it does not exists at all and everything which is called secular is a form of pseudo-secular.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2013/2013-01-27-ld_library_path-is-not-working-in-makefile/>LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not working in Makefile</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
If LD_LIBRARY_PATH is exported in Makefile and makefile is not working as you have expected, then you should try updating LIBRARY_PATH.
LIBRARY_PATH is used by gcc before compilation to search for directories containing libraries that need to be linked to your program.
If you wish to link static libraries, you should update LIBRARY_PATH and not LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I made a mistake and suffered for 2 hours.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used by your program to search for directories containing the libraries after it has been successfully compiled and linked.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Most likely all of the links mentioned on hub-list page are now dead. If there are lot of enlightened (and pervert) users over LAN then there would definitely be some Direct Connection (DC) hubs. And IIT Bombay is no exception. DC-hubs are maintained by undergraduate students. They download and share most of the data. I am greatly thankful to them for sharing latest animated movies etc. They have the enthusiasm and energy of young.&mldr;

<span class=description>
To one of his admirers, no less than a Ramachandra Guha, Ashis Nandy is &lsquo;an unclassifiable social scientist&rsquo;. He mixes psychology and philosophy with sociology to a magical effect, some would say to a corrupting effect. I can not imagine anyone who would read him without being deeply influenced. His masterpiece &lsquo;The intimate enemy&rsquo; have decolonized some minds. His work continues to have a deep impact on South Asian intellectual culture.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Your IITian-ness, You may or may not be conscious of it, but your appetite for comparison and self-congratulation if not narcissism is colossal. I understand that success in competitive examinations boosts one&rsquo;s confidence and increases one&rsquo;s pride in one&rsquo;s abilities. If such a pride drives you to hone your intellectual abilities, technical capabilities and professional skills further &ndash; so you can be among the best in your game &ndash; then anyone can hardly have anything against it.&mldr;

<span class=description>
I have been a teaching assistant in IIT Bombay since 2007. In otherwise a continuous stint, there was a gap of one year when I worked in industry after completing my masters. I prefer programming and lab related courses. I take a perverse interest in figuring out which student has copied his/her assignment. There have been many instances of cheating in those courses; and my intention is to comment on it.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Finally, I stumbled upon something on how to manage labels in mutt. See this post . I have been using mutt for two years but I never really needed this feature. As the usage of email is increasing, this is a great way to label the emails. It is much better than tagging. Good thing about it that it adds label to &lsquo;X-label&rsquo; field of the mail itself and display it in the pager.&mldr;

<span class=description>
A small program tingu is implemented in haskell. It reads minterms from a file and produce the output on console. It is hosted on github. You can use it like
./tingu -i minterms
Your minterms should be described in a file like following
vars = 4 minterms = 1,2,5,7,8,9,10,13,15,
Then output of program is
Hello, I am Tingu, the mighty crab! And I like tea. You should call me $./tingu -i filename from your terminal.&mldr;

What I try to do is look at the survival strategies of the poor, which is a much more interesting journalism. I try to focus not on the ‘events’ but on the ‘processes’ of poverty.&mldr;

After completing my post-graduation from IIT Bombay and before joining my new job in Noida, I was at home when my mother asked me about my classmates: where are they and what are they doing. I told her that I know few of them and most of them are in &lsquo;videsh&rsquo; (read Europe or US) for work or higher studies. Hearing this, she made a pitiful face and said with deep sympathy, ‘Ha!&mldr;
