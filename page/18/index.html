Modified on : Oct 24 ( First two comments were before that)
Anyway, nothing can be more wrong than assuming than all of her students have no concern for her well being. Since the most beloved newspaper of Indian middle class &ldquo;The Times of Idiots&rdquo; - the mirror of their thoughts, their undoing - only loves NRI&rsquo;s and have no self-dignity to take pride in homemade valuable things. This is not surprising that they desperately grab whatever they can find Indian in remotely successful things e.&mldr;

<span class=description>
UPDATE : Source code has moved to a git repository, http://github.com/dilawar/sound . The project README file has the updated instructions. Instructions here may be outdated. This post is for demo purposes only. This work is a derivative of Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s work http://people.msoe.edu/~taylor/examples/wav.htm . There was a bug in his implementation which is removed from this implementation.
A C++ class to read WAV file and store its content in an array. We also store these values in an ASCII file and plot it using gnuplot to check whether we get it right.&mldr;

This is draft.
Why do you despise the culture of the language you speak every day of your lives, the only language which your mother and sister understand?
Dr. J. Ballantyne, (Title of the essay he gave to his students
to write in an attempt to improve their Hindi)
We do not clearly understand what you European mean by the term Hindi, for there are hundreds of dialects, all in our opinion equally entitled for the name, and there is no standard as there is in Sanskrit&mldr; If the purity of Hindi is to consist in its exclusiveness of Mussulman words, we shall require to study Persian and Arabic in order to ascertain which of the words are in the habit of issuing every day inArabic or Persian, and which is Hindi.&mldr;

<span class=description>
This is version 0.5 There is a bug in this implementation, since hole concentration is constant in both side of the junction. Thanks to Urmimala for pointing this out.. In ver 1.0, we&rsquo;ll provide complete documentation and will remove this bug. The pn-junction is quite an interesting junction. If most the semiconductor theory can be tested around it, it also poses significant challenges in numerical method also. In this implementation in Scilab, we are solving Poisson equation to get the results when junction is in equilibrium.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2010/2010-10-06-linear-feedback-shift-register-c-implementation/>Linear Feedback Shift Register : C++ implementation</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) arises in many applications, especially in communications. See wiki page for a good introduction http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register. We implemented LFSR in C++ which can be found here https://ee717-iitb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/A5-1/ . You can download this code by using svn. If you are not aware of svn then you can simply download these files manually. This is a make file project. After having all these files in a directory; command make all should build it.&mldr;

<span class=description>
By most accounts, life of a Teaching Assistant (TA) is quite simple. Go to the lab, do the assigned work and come back. If you are TA for a theory course then professor usually asks you to do work related with script checking, grading and other related clerk-work. There is a space for improvement but most of the professors do not want to overburden their TA&rsquo;s. They generally leave them with these routine works.&mldr;

Version 0.9 [Do not trust anything less than Version 1.0 even if it is made by me.] Report bugs to dilawar@ee.iitb.ac.in
1. Modified Nodal Analysis We implemented modified nodal analysis (MNA) in Scilab even though I do not like this method. It is very bad for circuits having more than few thousand nodes. It is implemented mostly for my understanding purpose. Anyway, please make sure your circuit description file defined in Sec 2.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Someone who has access to market and someone who has access to capital came up with an evil plan. They want to make a VLSI circuit and then they will fabricate it and sell it to puny humans to make money [Evil laugh]. What they want to create will surely depend on what their consumers will find useful. So they hire someone who has expertise in consumer electronics and pays her to figure out what they can sell to them with some good profit.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2010/2010-09-05-whats-there-in-language/>What's there in Language?</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
Languages are not an easy thing to get curious about. The first time I got curious about languages was when I read about deconstruction in CAT exam preparatory material over which my room-mate was loosing sleep. Later it turns out that there are much more to a language than these school of thoughts.
Lets get curious about why language evolved in the first place. From the top of my mind, to woo a pretty girl by uttering something which does not make sense, to gain influence in a group by saying something which other would find impressive, to disseminate your ideologies.&mldr;

“The intellectual potentialities of the Indian nation are unlimited and not many years would perhaps be needed before India can take a worthy place in world mathematics.&mldr;
