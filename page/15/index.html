<span class=description>
&lsquo;What exactly is a genius&rsquo; is a very hard question to answer. Hard still is answering &lsquo;who is perceived to be a genius&rsquo;.[[ To do : The idea of natural inequality ]] We often see a &lsquo;genius&rsquo; as a gifted person, endowed by nature her supreme gift - intelligence. Many, however, believe that &lsquo;practise makes a man perfect&rsquo;. They argue that a person can be made &lsquo;genius&rsquo; by giving him enough time to grow with a suitable training and education.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Statement Define a function isPrime which accepts a number n, and returns True if n is prime and False otherwise. The easiest way to test the primality of a number is to test whether it has any factor. This is usally done by dividing the given number by the smallest prime number i.e. 2 first. If this divides the number, we declare that the given number is not prime, else we repeat the process with next prime number.&mldr;

<span class=description>
How little space is given to poverty, labour and agriculture reporting in Indian media is no secret. This week EPW edition has published a study high-lightening percentage of new-items in Hindi-English media about rural area. This study says that &lsquo;.. India’s highest circulated English and Hindi dailies finds that they devote only a minuscule proportion of their total coverage (about 2%) to rural India’s issues, crises and anxieties. Even this low count could be misleading because most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming.&mldr;

<span class=description>
&mldr;For five years, I gave the shortlisted candidates for our M.Tech (IT) entrance a short second test. In one of the questions, I would ask them to write something in English about their family, then rewrite the same thing in their mother-tongue or in any other Indian language they knew. Invariably, people who wrote bad English also wrote bad Hindi, bad Marathi, bad Telugu, etc. My belief, therefore, is that poor writing is a result of lack of mental discipline to write properly.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Civil Society is not a new idea - if we consider that voluntary actions and individual initiative are at heart of it - its presence in India is rather new. Fifty years ago, except for Marxist who drew inspiration of Gramsci rather than Lenin, we did not hear much talk about civil society. These days, civil society has taken the center-stage. People from a very ill defined category of public intellectuals are writing articles on it but it is not at all convincing that they are talking about the same thing.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Sixty years after the the independence, two phenomena are ubiquitous these days. One is the manner in which public anxiety shows itself over many problems with which our public institutes are beset - misuse of funds, lack of discipline, absenteeism, work stoppage, strikes and so on - all of which are in some way related with failure of some regulatory rules. Second, the growth of civil societies which seems to be outcome of government failure on social front, like markets which were the outcome of government failures on economic front.&mldr;

My apologies for being a reactionary. Mr. Jairam Ramesh - a relatively respected union minister who has given hopes to everyone who are concerned with environment - is an IITB alumnus. He is well known to take u-turns on his statements. He recently made a remark about IIT/IIM which seems to have roused some emotions. His statement is fortified by none other than our HRD minister who once conveniently compared loss of billions of rupee in 2G scam to &lsquo;no-loss to exchequer&rsquo;.&mldr;

<span class=description>
The accusation that Indian society is incapable of changing by itself came from various Western thinkers. Most prominent among them was Karl Marx, a man of immense intellect. In his essay, The British Rule in India, he wrote that &lsquo;England, it is true, in causing a social revolution in Hindostan, was actuated only by the vilest interests, and was stupid in her manner of enforcing them. But that is not the question.&mldr;

<span class=description>
There will not be any civilization worth the name if it does not grant certain amount of privacy to its members. But different civilizations put different premium on it. Privacy does not fascinate Indians much. Most of us will see it with indifference. I am not aware of a large amount of work done on &lsquo;privacy&rsquo; by our sociologists. We lack a sound theory on it. Our understanding and appreciation of privacy is very low.&mldr;

“Read not to contradict and confute, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider”
-- Francis Bacon
The man who has not the habit of reading is imprisoned in his immediate world, in respect to time and space. His life falls into a set routine; he is limited to contact and conversation with a few friends and acquaintances, and he sees only what happens in his immediate neighbourhood.&mldr;
