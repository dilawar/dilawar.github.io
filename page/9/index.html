<span class=description>
The idea behind literate programming, that a program can be a piece of literature, is due to Donald E. Knuth. Knuth is an extremely respected figure in programming community (and also among combinatorics and computer science people). In this paradigm, one does not write a program based on how computer would reason about it but rather follows a human like flow. It is the job of literate programming tool to convert this human-readable program into something which make sense to a computer.&mldr;

‘I will pay my debt to society through research in my subject. And beyond this, I owe no other debt to society.’ Having resolved this, she went on.
—Vidyadhar Pundalik (1970) on Irawati Karve
It was my undergraduate when I had my first rigorous encounter with city-schooled boys and girls. I was fresh out of a small village and landed in Chennai. This encounter gave me clues about our intellectual culture, for most if not all of our intellectuals come from this background.&mldr;

<span class=description>
I wrote a Haskell implementation of a popular game Hangman. Hangman thinks of a word and tells you its length. You get that many chance to guess it. The procedure of guessing is following assuming length of the word is n.
You guess a letter, if the word contains that letter, hangman reveals the location of this letter. You still have n more guesses. If the word does not contain your letter, your no of guesses is reduced by 1.&mldr;

<span class=description>
A program written in declarative paradigm does not specify &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo;, at best, it tells the computer &ldquo;what to do&rdquo;. The spice-netlist is one such example, here we tell ngspice or some other spice (circuit simulator), what to compute (like .OP, .DC, .AC etc.). To be sure, this distinction is rather based on arguments which are nothing but &ldquo;hand-waving&rdquo;, but too many people use these terms to ignore them.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Recently, a friend taught me a simple game of bulls and cows. This game goes like this. There are two players, A and B. A thinks of a 4-letter word and asks B to guess it. Assume that A thought of “link” and B guesses “lean”. The bulls are the number of letters which are common to both words at the same location in both words , for example “l” is a bull in &ldquo;link&rdquo; and &ldquo;lean&rdquo;.&mldr;

<span class=description>
One of our national dailies reports that Madras High court has ordered a CBI inquiry into what is a quintessential internal affair of IIT Madras, namely the process of appointing faculty [1]. The process of selecting students and appointing faculty are vital to any university health and must be a prerogative of the university. It may be true that all committees do not always act in good faith given how deeply dependence and patronage is rooted in our society but even if they act in good faith, the decision may not be agreeable to all.&mldr;

<span class=description>
There is a growing tendency these days among intellectuals to attack secularism. In the past such attacks were indirect and covert somewhat similar to the attack on equality; they hesitated to attack it openly. They maintained since we can not define secularism in a strict sense, like equality, it will be good if we stop using the term altogether, at least to avoid the intellectual confusion. More adventurous among them argued that it does not exists therefore anything which is labeled as secular can only be pseudo-secular.&mldr;

<span class=description>
If you are a mutt user and working at NCBS Bangalore, you can setup your account in mutt as following. set from="REAL_NAME " set from="USER NAME " set hostname="imaps://imap.ncbs.res.in" set folder="imaps://imap.ncbs.res.in" set record="+INBOX.Sent" set imap_user="NCBS_USER" set imap_pass="NCBS_PASS" set postponed="=Drafts" set spoolfile="+INBOX" set signature="sign.txt" set smtp_url="smtp://NCBS_USER@mail.ncbs.res.in" smtp_pass="$NCBS_PASS" set realname="$REAL_NAME" In short incoming server is imap.ncbs.res.in and outgoing server is mail.ncbs.res.in. Use default ports. To get smtp server information, you can always use (in terminal) msmtp -v --host=mail.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2013/2013-07-30-review-yuganta-by-irawati-karve/>Review: Culture and values in Mahabharata</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1148&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;261&rdquo;] It is more than a mere commentary on characters of Mahabharata.[/caption] Irawati was an anthropologist and she writes like one. It is rare but not unusual for an anthropologists to mine classical texts to gain some insight about a by-gone age. As an anthropologist, she studied structure of kinship in Mahabharata but in this book we are for a different kind of treat. This work is her personal commentary on some major characters in the epic.&mldr;

<span class=description>
&mldr; but one must not be surprised if outsiders don&rsquo;t take Haskell too seriously&mldr; [We] say a lot about what functional programming isn&rsquo;t: It has no assignment, no side effect, no flow of control but not much about what it is. The functional programmer sounds rather a medieval monk, denying himself the pleasures of life in hope that it will make him virtuous. To those interested in material benefits, these &lsquo;advantages&rsquo; are totally unconvincing.&mldr;
