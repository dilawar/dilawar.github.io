<span class=description>
From : Back page of &lsquo;Bombay Pentangular&rsquo;, S. K. Roy (1945) featuring C. K. Rayudu - India&rsquo;s first great cricketer.
Major C.K. Nayudu, once again, as on the first day of the match, was the idol of the huge crowd. Whether ‘C.K.’ played a ball, sent down a delivery or did some fielding, everything was cheered. Going out after tea on Sunday, he was literally mobbed by youthful admirers, each wanting to tap their hero on the back.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Following table is an outcome of notes taken for sole purpose of generalising Left and Right politics. Left politics is usually confused with ideology of some political parties. Such views of politics in popular media are confusing if not contradictory. The distinction made between Left and Right was of French origin where the Left is called &ldquo;the party of movement&rdquo; and the Right &ldquo;the party of order&rdquo;. To be sure, there is no black-and-white distinction between these two political culture.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Some human, largely in West, found insects worthy of their curiosity. Some have filmed and photographed them, wrote about them, imagined and personified them, few lived among them to study their life. David Attenborough narrates their life : showing us faces of their life : beautiful, cruel and benign. European, in particular, were very interested in insects. No one have popularised insects more than Walt Disney. One can accuse Disney of some bias for one gets the impression that Disney preferred ants, grasshopper, butterflies much more than any other insects (spider is not an insect, is it?&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2011/2011-10-27-great-openings/>In praise of : Great Openings</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
It has been advised not to judge a book by its cover (here are some clues if you do) but they did not say anything about its opening lines, which surely is a fair game. For if the author can&rsquo;t take the trouble to carve out a good starting point from where rest of the story suppose to flow, then how she would handle the peak where interpretive pressure is highest.&mldr;

<a class=title href=/posts/2011/2011-10-18-a-note-on-sankrit-root-of-daughter-idea-of-devata/>A Note on Sankrit : Root of 'Daughter', Idea of Devata</a> &mdash;
<span class=description>
Daughter
The theory goes like that English &lsquo;daughter&rsquo;, German &lsquo;Tochter&rsquo;, Greek &lsquo;thygater&rsquo;, Irish &lsquo;dear&rsquo;, Lithuanian &lsquo;dukte&rsquo;, Russian &lsquo;doch&rsquo;, are common derivation with the Sankrit root &lsquo;duh&rsquo; (to milk), so the word was, according to this theory, originally &lsquo;dogdhri&rsquo; = she who milks, to indicate that it was the daughter of a primitive aryan family who did the milking. This charming picture was first drawn by Lassen, quoted with approval by Max Muller, plagiarised by various Indian authors in deservedly obscure writings, re-adopted from Marathi and have now gain an unforseen sanctity by the virtue omission and commission during translation.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Hangman in Haskell Rule of Hangman You play this game with a man called Hangman. The job of hangman is to kill you. Hangman is fair and have some rules. He is abided by these rules.
Hangman writes down a secret word. Let the word is W and its length is n. He asks you to guess a letter of W. Whenever you guess a letter which is in W, hangman shows you that part of the word.&mldr;

<span class=description>
It took a man like Sainath to break the story of paid news in public in the newspaper The Hindu.
PCI (Press council of India) made a committee to look into the matter of paid news which came down heavily on &lsquo;the big guys&rsquo;. The report they submitted named the names which the &lsquo;big guys&rsquo; did not like. They successfully buried its report - in the watered down version of this report, original report was reduced to a footnote.&mldr;

It has been said that &lsquo;behind every great thinker lies a lesser begin who shall translate, collate, annotate or otherwise facilitate his work.&rsquo; So James Boswell followed Dr. Johnson around the pubs of London, first &lsquo;committing to memory, and thereafter to print, every word uttered in cups&rsquo;. Ernest Jones and Strachey assumed the job of biographer and translator respectively of Sigmund Freud. Being a German, Friedrich Engels took his job rather seriously.&mldr;
