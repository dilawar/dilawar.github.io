<span class=description>
John Hopfield in 1982 proposed a neat idea. It was a network that could store memories and recall them when presented with a partial cue. There are many tutorials out there on Hopfield network (my personal favourite is https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch17.S1.html, the original paper is a great read as well.).
These networks are highly studied. Despite their limitations and non-biological nature, they are still very popular among neuroscientits for their simplicity and tractability.&mldr;

I recently discovered pyenv. I think it&rsquo;s cool. It lets me setting up Python version easily on my Linux box.
It is not written in Python and it is not installable using pip. Executing pip install pyenv in terminal didn&rsquo;t work for me.
I used the system package manager to install it: sudo zypper install pyenv (on OpenSUSE).
Here is $ tldr pyenv for it.
pyenv
Switch between multiple versions of Python easily.&mldr;

Reason: During the update of a plugin or a theme, you refreshed the page, moved to another page, or the upgrade failed due to some other reason.
WordPress creates .maintenace file in the top-level directory before the start of the update process. And removes it if the upgrade is successful.
Solution: Delete the .maintenace file.&mldr;

You want to lift India on your fingertip. You have already sliced the country using a cosmic knife 1 km below the sea level. Where would you keep your finger? Remember the Indian plate needs to be balanced.
There is no easy answer to this question. The estimates, however, are easier to make. One such estimate is below. There are two markers on the map. The one in the state of Madhya Pradesh (MP) is the centroid of the country.&mldr;

I am happy to see my expository article published in Resonance this month. I used to read Resonance in my college days and some articles were edifying. The journal has been declining in the quality lately.
My article is available for free from here: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-019-0863-8. It is also available from Indian Academy of Sciences website: https://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/024/09/0963-0975.
We forget often. But some memories last a lifetime. This means that our brain is capable of protecting memories for years.&mldr;

<span class=description>
Recently my paper was published in eLife. It deals with an important question: How do we maintain long-lasting memories?. The eLife feature team did a great job in writing a layman summary for this paper which I am reproducing below:
The brain stores memories by changing the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. Synapses that change their strength easily can quickly encode new information. But such synapses are also unstable.&mldr;

<span class=description>
I am a heavy user of matplotlib but secretly I am in love with tikz (well who isn&rsquo;t!). I&rsquo;ve been training myself with tikz and pgfplots for few years now, by drawing (umm.. coding) figures for labnotes, journal club and student&rsquo;s seminars. For my recent paper published in eLife, I used tikz/pgfplots to draw all my figures and the results were awesome!
[gallery ids=&ldquo;2113,2114,2115,2116,2117,2118,2119,2120,2121&rdquo; type=&ldquo;rectangular&rdquo;]
The code and data used to generate these figures are available on my Github repository.&mldr;

<span class=description>
I often try to remember how much each mode of transportation costs the environment. Data published by UK government has good numbers. These data can probably be used as proxy for India with some caveats. The buses emit more carbon and almost certain to carry many more passengers; same goes with trains. I could not find such numbers published for any Indian city. Let&rsquo;s assume that
A plane carries 100 passengers.&mldr;
