Finding good quality electronic component online is a big challenge for a
person without deep pockets. There are usually two options: go to likes of
https://digikey.in and https://mouser.in and spend quite a lot for premium
quality products, or go to local market where most stuff is of poor quality.
For prototyping stage, hobbyist, early stage startup (like us), and students,
finding a vendor who can deliver a good compromise is very challenging. 

Fortunately there are some options. I’ve used following stores to buy
components especially boards, sensors and other kits. I am very happy with
their services. Both of them did prompt deliveries.

- [robu.in](https://robu.in)
- [evelta](https://evelta.com)

You can easily find popular boards, kits and general purpose sensors are
available. At the time of writing, robu has larger inventory and evelta has
some newer boards. In fact, after going through their inventories, we replaced
ST boards with a respeaker board for prototyping since the ecosystem around
respeaker board is open-source and easy to starts with. Getting started with a
st-board was relatively hard (theirs docs are still in PDF!!)

Both of these stores have ticketing systems for support. Most Indian shops are
yet to learn a lot about customer support. I’ve not yet used evelta support.
I’ve had queries for robu about available products. Robu was responsive. All in
all, happy to see that local ecosystem is getting better. Best wishes to both
of them!
