I've used following stores to buy electronic components especially boards,
sensors and other kits. I am happy with their services. The deliver was prompt
from both of the stores. 

- [robu.in](https://robu.in)
- [evelta](https://www.evelta.com/)

You can't find all the components you need but popular boards, kits and
general purpose sensors are available. At the time of writing, robu has larger
inventory and evelta has some newer boards.

I've not yet used evelta support since I had no issue with them. I've queries
robu a couple of time about available products. Robu is very responsive.
Fortunately they use a ticketing system so someone responds sooner than later.
Their website may use some work in the future.
