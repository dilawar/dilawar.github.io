###### These notes are taken from "nature neuroscience" review "computational principles of memory", volume 19, Number 3, march 2016.

Definition: "_any panoply of changes in the activity or connectivity of neural systems that are triggered by stimuli or brain states and then persists over a duration longer than the triggering events._" **Benefits of having memory:**

- can learn from experience
- generalize faster
- recall prior information to better infer or predict from incomplete data
- perform computation by accumulating/integrating information over time
- search/decision making

(last 2 needs some more circuitry in addition to memory). **Short term memory:** lasts for seconds to few tens of seconds. **Long term memory:** lasts hours to decades. No
