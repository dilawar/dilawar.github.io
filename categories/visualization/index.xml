You have already sliced the country using a cosmic knife 1 km below the sea level. Where would you keep your finger? Remember the Indian plate needs to be balanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no easy answer to this question. The estimates, however, are easier to make. One such estimate is below. There are two markers on the map. The one in the state of Madhya Pradesh (MP) is the centroid of the country. If you draw a map on a paper, the middle point of the map is the centroid. But you lift the country at the centroid, it won&amp;rsquo;t be balanced; the Himalayas are heavy and it will tilt the country to the north.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making figures with TikZ/pgfplots for scientific publishing in Biology</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a heavy user of &lt;code>matplotlib&lt;/code> but secretly I am in love with &lt;code>tikz&lt;/code> (well who isn&amp;rsquo;t!). I&amp;rsquo;ve been training myself with tikz and pgfplots for few years now, by drawing (umm.. coding) figures for labnotes, journal club and student&amp;rsquo;s seminars. For &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41412">my recent paper published in eLife&lt;/a>, I used tikz/pgfplots to draw all my figures and the results were awesome!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The code and data used to generate these figures are available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/dilawar/SinghAndBhalla_CaMKII_SubunitExchange_2018/PaperFigures/">my Github repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
