He works and lives in western U.P., a relatively
prosperous area in terms of ground-water and road connectivity. He is
not sufficiently poor. He managed to pay for my college (circa 2007).
I spent the first 21 years of my life in the village, often working on
the farms. It is a hard life once you have experienced the alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are sugar-cane farmers and are well organized. Usually, politicians
don&amp;rsquo;t like to mess up with organized farmers. But a hyper-centralized
state can. After all, everyone is living in their own bubbles these days.
Some powerful people will always believe that they know best what is
good for everyone else. This is not true even when they have the noblest
of intentions and act in good faith. And this bill was not passed in a
good faith.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
