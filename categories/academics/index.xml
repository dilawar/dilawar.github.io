The eLife feature team did &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/digests/41412/unstable-synapses-form-stable-memories">a great job in writing a layman summary&lt;/a> for this paper which I am reproducing below:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The brain stores memories by changing the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. Synapses that change their strength easily can quickly encode new information. But such synapses are also unstable. They tend to revert back to their original state and so struggle to retain information. By contrast, synapses that are slow to change their strength are slow to learn, but are good at remembering. The difference is a little like that between writing a message in wet sand versus carving it into stone. It is quick and easy to write on sand, but the resulting marks are temporary. Writing on stone is slow and difficult, but the results last far longer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
