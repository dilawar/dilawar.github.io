It was a network that could store memories and recall them when presented with a partial cue. There are many tutorials out there on Hopfield network (my personal favourite is &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fneuronaldynamics.epfl.ch%2Fonline%2FCh17.S1.html&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGkguSyzf2wqjGnE43Vb2ZgK-bAFg">https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch17.S1.html&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcontent%2F79%2F8%2F2554&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH9Hx14XDoV7ImQ5QRiGlapmqyQag">original paper&lt;/a> is a great read as well.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These networks are highly studied. Despite their limitations and non-biological nature, they are still very popular among neuroscientits for their simplicity and tractability. Their storage capacity is barely enough: a network with N neurons stores roughly 0.14N memories (still linear though).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
