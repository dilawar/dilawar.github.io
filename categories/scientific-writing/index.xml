The eLife feature team did &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/digests/41412/unstable-synapses-form-stable-memories">a great job in writing a layman summary&lt;/a> for this paper which I am reproducing below:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The brain stores memories by changing the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. Synapses that change their strength easily can quickly encode new information. But such synapses are also unstable. They tend to revert back to their original state and so struggle to retain information. By contrast, synapses that are slow to change their strength are slow to learn, but are good at remembering. The difference is a little like that between writing a message in wet sand versus carving it into stone. It is quick and easy to write on sand, but the resulting marks are temporary. Writing on stone is slow and difficult, but the results last far longer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making figures with TikZ/pgfplots for scientific publishing in Biology</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a heavy user of &lt;code>matplotlib&lt;/code> but secretly I am in love with &lt;code>tikz&lt;/code> (well who isn&amp;rsquo;t!). I&amp;rsquo;ve been training myself with tikz and pgfplots for few years now, by drawing (umm.. coding) figures for labnotes, journal club and student&amp;rsquo;s seminars. For &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41412">my recent paper published in eLife&lt;/a>, I used tikz/pgfplots to draw all my figures and the results were awesome!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The code and data used to generate these figures are available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/dilawar/SinghAndBhalla_CaMKII_SubunitExchange_2018/PaperFigures/">my Github repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
