**UPDATE : Source code has moved to a git repository, http://github.com/dilawar/sound . The project README file has the updated instructions. Instructions here may be outdated. This post is for demo purposes only.** **This work is a derivative of Dr. Taylor's work** [http://people.msoe.edu/~taylor/examples/wav.htm](http://people.msoe.edu/~taylor/examples/wav.htm) . **There was a bug in his implementation which is removed from this implementation.**

A C++ class to read WAV file and store its content in an array. We also store these values in an ASCII file and plot it using `gnuplot` to check whether we get it right. [`praat`](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) can be used to confirm whether our output is right or not. Google to read about the WAV format. **We only support a non-compressed WAV file.**

# **WAV File Format**

We do not support the compressed WAV file. The format which is programmed here is available here [https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/).

# Implementation

The Makefile project can be found at github repository http://github.com/dilawar/sound .Â  After compilation (using `make all)`, you'll get the binary `parseSpeech`. Use this binary `./parseSpeech -f` . If your wav file is long (more than 3-4 seconds) the txt file generated by this program `speechData.txt` will be very lengthy. Use can use `gnuplot` to draw the waveform.
