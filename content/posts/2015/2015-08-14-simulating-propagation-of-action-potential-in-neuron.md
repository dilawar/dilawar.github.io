This example is pretty simple: create a dendrite with 1000 compartments with Hodgkin and Â Huxley channels, inject current at both ends and also in middle and see how action potential propagates in the cable. This simulation is done using MOOSE simulator (https://moose.ncbs.res.in). \[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqu32SbOSO8\]
