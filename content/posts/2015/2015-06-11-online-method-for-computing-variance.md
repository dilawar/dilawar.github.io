This method is due to Welford, described in TAOCP - Volume 2 by Donald E. Knuth. The merit of this method is discussed by many people \[[1](http://jonisalonen.com/2013/deriving-welfords-method-for-computing-variance/)\]\[[2](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/09/26/comparing-three-methods-of-computing-standard-deviation/)\]. [This pdf note](https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/d5e7edce-9463-4b44-bb9a-0d719fc4f383/files/Welford_method.pdf) shows how to derive Welford recursive relation. \[embed\]https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/d5e7edce-9463-4b44-bb9a-0d719fc4f383/files/Welford\_method.pdf\[/embed\]
