I am happy to see my expository article published in Resonance this month. I used to read Resonance in my college days and some articles were edifying. The journal has been declining in the quality lately.

My article is available for free from here: [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-019-0863-8](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-019-0863-8). It is also available from Indian Academy of Sciences website: [https://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/024/09/0963-0975](https://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/024/09/0963-0975).

> We forget often. But some memories last a lifetime. This means that our brain is capable of protecting memories for years. This is a remarkable feat given that the _biochemical hardware_ involved in creating new memories is a hostile place for its storage. What are the challenges involved? And what type of biochemical mechanisms may overcome them? This article explores a major hypothesis that molecular switches may be behind our remarkable ability to remember for a lifetime.
