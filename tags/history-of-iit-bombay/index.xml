Russian contribution in establishing IIT Bombay was tremendous. You can measure their contribution by noting that on our website &amp;lsquo;history of IIT Bombay&amp;rsquo; page acknowledges it in six lines out of total ten lines written about IIT-B history. 60% by line numbers and since these 6 lines are longer, their contribution become larger if one take &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo; written about it as a unit.</description></item></channel></rss>
