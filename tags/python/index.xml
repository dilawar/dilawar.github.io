Here is one implementation.
def argmax(ls : list) -&amp;gt; int: _m, _mi = -math.inf, 0 # requires `import math` at top for i, v in enumerate(ls): if v &amp;gt; _m: _m = v _mi = i return _mi There is also a one-liner which I often use: max(zip(ls, range(len(ls))))[1] where ls is the input list. To my surprise, the one liner is slower than argmax defined above (Python3.</description></item><item><title>Debugging python extension in gdb</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-11-03-debugging-python-extension-in-gdb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-11-03-debugging-python-extension-in-gdb/</guid><description>$ gdb -ex r --args python myscript.py If you are using virtual environment then you are likely to run into the following error.
/home/dilawars/PY38/shims/python&amp;quot;: not in executable format: File format not recognized
Because, in virtualenv, the command python is a bash script wrapping the real python executable. To bypass this, just do the following:

For example in the following __getindex__ method which implements [], argument key could be a single int, for example, a[1] or a[-3]; or it could be a slice e.g., a[1:4] is a slice.
def __getitem__(self, key): x = [1,2,3,4,5,6] # fixed data if isinstance(key, slice): return [x[i] for i in slice2range(slice, len(x)] return x[key] Ideally, I\&amp;rsquo;d have loved if range(key) would automatically turn/cast a slice to the equivalent range.</description></item><item><title>Managing multiple versions of Python using pyenv</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-09-28-managing-different-versions-of-python-using-pyenv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2020/2020-09-28-managing-different-versions-of-python-using-pyenv/</guid><description>I recently discovered pyenv. I think it&amp;rsquo;s cool. It lets me setting up Python version easily on my Linux box.
It is not written in Python and it is not installable using pip. Executing pip install pyenv in terminal didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.
I used the system package manager to install it: sudo zypper install pyenv (on OpenSUSE).
Here is $ tldr pyenv for it.
pyenv
Switch between multiple versions of Python easily.</description></item><item><title>Simulating Random Walks using Langevin Equation</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-10-30-simulating-random-walks-using-langevin-equation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2014/2014-10-30-simulating-random-walks-using-langevin-equation/</guid><description>Random walks (Brownian motions), in addition to their theoretical potency (describes macro-scale behavior of gas starting with micro-scale description), also describes behavior of many processes in nature. A few of them; genetic network, protein expression caused by mRNA,Â have been described/predicted well using stochasticity. Moreover they are ideal noise sources cause by thermal fluctuation and often found in natural processes. To get the solid foundation in this subject, see the classic &amp;ldquo;Stochatic Processes in Physics and Chemistry&amp;rdquo; by Van Kampen, and also &amp;ldquo;handbook of stochastic methods&amp;rdquo; by Gandiner.</description></item></channel></rss>
