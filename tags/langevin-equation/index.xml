A few of them; genetic network, protein expression caused by mRNA,Â have been described/predicted well using stochasticity. Moreover they are ideal noise sources cause by thermal fluctuation and often found in natural processes. To get the solid foundation in this subject, see the classic &amp;ldquo;Stochatic Processes in Physics and Chemistry&amp;rdquo; by Van Kampen, and also &amp;ldquo;handbook of stochastic methods&amp;rdquo; by Gandiner.</description></item></channel></rss>
