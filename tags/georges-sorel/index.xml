He mixes psychology and philosophy with sociology to a magical effect, some would say to a corrupting effect. I can not imagine anyone who would read him without being deeply influenced. His masterpiece &amp;lsquo;The intimate enemy&amp;rsquo;Â have decolonized some minds. His work continues to have a deep impact on South Asian intellectual culture.</description></item></channel></rss>
