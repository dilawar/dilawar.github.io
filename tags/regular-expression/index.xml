This is equivalent of checking if you graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Assume that each vertex of graph has a label such as A, B, C, etc. While you are traversing the graph, you keep your labels of traversed vertices on a stack or in a vector. If you construct a string out of this traversal, you will get a pattern like the following one.</description></item></channel></rss>
