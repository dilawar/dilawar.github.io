May be hiking is some sort of spiritual experience for him as doing assignments is for me. He planned for a night hiking around Antergange. Oliver told me that we&amp;rsquo;d pass through some villages during trekking, I enthusiastically joined them. Also I like the company of a girl who promised to joined us. We started from NCBS Bagalore around 4pm and reached Majestic bus station around 5pm and took a bus to Kolar from Terminal 3, platform 8.</description></item></channel></rss>
