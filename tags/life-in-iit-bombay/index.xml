The doyen of Indian anthropology M. N. Srivinas said that an anthropologist is born thrice. He is &amp;lsquo;once-born&amp;rsquo; when he initially goes to the field,Â away from his familiar surroundings to put himself in a world of which he has little clue. He is &amp;lsquo;twice-born&amp;rsquo; when, on living for some time among his chosen tribe, he is able to see things from their view-point.</description></item></channel></rss>
