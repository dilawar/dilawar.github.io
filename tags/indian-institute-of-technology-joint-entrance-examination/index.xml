It was sent to IITB general mailing list, meant for notification about events on the campus. This email was written for anyone &amp;lsquo;who is concerned with IIT Bombay future&amp;rsquo;. Thus I read it. The sender is a member of student body. He was disappointed with the little interests shown by IIT Bombay student community for the debate on new single entrance examination proposed of Government of India.</description></item></channel></rss>
