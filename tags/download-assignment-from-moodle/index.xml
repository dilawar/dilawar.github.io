Output of both is same but they work on different version of moodle. This script (with configuration file available inside the repo) should work with new moodle while this one (with this configuration) should work with old moodle. Downloading each student&amp;rsquo;s assignment from moodle could be a real pain. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my old scripts which download assignments from Moodle and stores each student&amp;rsquo;s assignment in a separate directory named after student.</description></item></channel></rss>
