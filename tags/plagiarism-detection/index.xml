I have used them in EE705 (VHDL, verilog) and found them very useful. It generates detailed log (which file matches which file) and sent emails to offenders with an archive of all file which were matched. It is integrated with my moodle-application (automatic download, extract, compare, sending-emails.) It also generates graphs (using python graph-tool) which shows the level of copying in the assignments.</description></item></channel></rss>
