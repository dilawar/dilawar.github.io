If you prefer easy to setup and click-based tools then you will not find mutt very exciting, however those who loves to split hair and tweak their tools to their whims will find much in mutt to please them.

There are many other blogs written about &amp;lsquo;mutt&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;getmail&amp;rsquo;. Surely you can take hints from any of them. This post is written for IIT Bombay email servers. You pathetic Windows guys, piss off!!
Get Emails from Server First of all, we need to use &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; to fetch emails from gpo server. Mutt can be used to read directly from server. But I like storing my emails on my machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
