On suspecting that bridegrooms is illiterate, the bride put him under an arithmetic test: &amp;ldquo;how much is 15 + 6?&amp;rdquo;. And when the answer given was 17, she called off the marriage. A few childhood memories popped up. When I was a kid, my father asked me once: &amp;ldquo;how much is left when you subtract 2.75 out of 4.25?&amp;rdquo;. The question is hard when Hindustani is used to describe fractions.</description></item><item><title>Daadi and me ...</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-04-27-daadi-and-me/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2010/2010-04-27-daadi-and-me/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;You call every old lady Dadi Ji, Tai Ji. But why don&amp;rsquo;t you call your own dadi, Dadi ji. All the time you call her Buddhiya (old woman)?&amp;rdquo;, Papa used to scold me. So when he was around, I&amp;rsquo;d call my grandmother, Dadi - still not Dadi Ji. Calling her Dadi Ji was too much. These benign respectful words are for outsiders. She is a friend, very fast friend. When Papa was not around, I&amp;rsquo;d simply say &amp;ldquo;Oye Buddhi&amp;hellip; ki haal chal&amp;hellip;?</description></item></channel></rss>
