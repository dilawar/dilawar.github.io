I used to read Resonance in my college days and some articles were edifying. The journal has been declining in the quality lately.
My article is available for free from here: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-019-0863-8. It is also available from Indian Academy of Sciences website: https://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/024/09/0963-0975.
