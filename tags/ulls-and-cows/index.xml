This game goes like this. There are two players, A and B. A thinks of a 4-letter word and asks B to guess it. Assume that A thought of “link” and B guesses “lean”. The bulls are the number of letters which are common to both words at the same location in both words , for example “l” is a bull in &amp;ldquo;link&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
