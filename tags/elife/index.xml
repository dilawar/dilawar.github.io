The eLife feature team did a great job in writing a layman summary for this paper which I am reproducing below:
The brain stores memories by changing the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. Synapses that change their strength easily can quickly encode new information. But such synapses are also unstable.</description></item><item><title>Making figures with TikZ/pgfplots for scientific publishing in Biology</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</guid><description>I am a heavy user of matplotlib but secretly I am in love with tikz (well who isn&amp;rsquo;t!). I&amp;rsquo;ve been training myself with tikz and pgfplots for few years now, by drawing (umm.. coding) figures for labnotes, journal club and student&amp;rsquo;s seminars. For my recent paper published in eLife, I used tikz/pgfplots to draw all my figures and the results were awesome!

The code and data used to generate these figures are available on my Github repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
