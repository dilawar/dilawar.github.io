Thanks to Urmimala for pointing this out.. In ver 1.0, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide complete documentation and will remove this bug. The pn-junction is quite an interesting junction. If most the semiconductor theory can be tested around it, it also poses significant challenges in numerical method also. In thisÂ implementation in Scilab, we are solving Poisson equation to get the results when junction is in equilibrium.</description></item></channel></rss>
