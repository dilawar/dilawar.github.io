It is written in Rust and suppose to replace find command.
fd is amazing, PERIOD. It has much better user experience. Check out the official demo below,
My pet peeve with find command is not that it has too many options, but that these options are hard to figure out. I don&amp;rsquo;t use find so often to build a muscle memory. So a simpler version is most welcome.</description></item></channel></rss>
