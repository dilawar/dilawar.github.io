He is denied affection to which its British counterpart has a social claim. The Pariah dog longs for a master; a mere approving look touches a chord is it heart. Compared with English dog, says Kipling, &amp;lsquo;the poor Indian outcast is a pagan, a creature without faith, or at least without that soul-saving reverence for authority which ennobles character&amp;rsquo; and concluded rightly that &amp;lsquo;the Pariah does not know the joy of adoration&amp;rsquo; for he has no master.</description></item></channel></rss>
