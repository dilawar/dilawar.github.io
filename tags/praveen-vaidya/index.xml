Interestingly this works uses spanning tree (approximate) in solving Linear Equations. Its was amazing that tree has to do anything with system of linear equations . See the attached beamer. Apparently they claim that they have found the fastest algorithm. In nutshell, they combined support theory with conjugate gradient methods. A lot of mathematicians work has been an integral part of this progress.</description></item></channel></rss>
