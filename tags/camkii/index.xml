I used to read Resonance in my college days and some articles were edifying. The journal has been declining in the quality lately.
My article is available for free from here: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-019-0863-8. It is also available from Indian Academy of Sciences website: https://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/024/09/0963-0975.
We forget often. But some memories last a lifetime. This means that our brain is capable of protecting memories for years.</description></item><item><title>Making figures with TikZ/pgfplots for scientific publishing in Biology</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2018/2018-11-23-making-figures-with-tikz-pgfplots-for-scientific-publishing-in-biology/</guid><description>I am a heavy user of matplotlib but secretly I am in love with tikz (well who isn&amp;rsquo;t!). I&amp;rsquo;ve been training myself with tikz and pgfplots for few years now, by drawing (umm.. coding) figures for labnotes, journal club and student&amp;rsquo;s seminars. ForÂ my recent paper published in eLife, I used tikz/pgfplots to draw all my figures and the results were awesome!

The code and data used to generate these figures are available on my Github repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
