I understand that success in competitive examinations boosts one&amp;rsquo;s confidence and increases one&amp;rsquo;s pride in one&amp;rsquo;s abilities. If such a pride drives you to hone your intellectual abilities, technical capabilities and professional skills further &amp;ndash; so you can be among the best in your game &amp;ndash; then anyone can hardly have anything against it.</description></item><item><title>An Anthropologist Among IITians</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2011/2011-11-29-an-anthropologist-among-iitians/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2011/2011-11-29-an-anthropologist-among-iitians/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a dreadful pity when a beautifully spacious generalisation is upset by one or two simple facts.

The doyen of Indian anthropology M. N. Srivinas said that an anthropologist is born thrice. He is &amp;lsquo;once-born&amp;rsquo; when he initially goes to the field,Â away from his familiar surroundings to put himself in a world of which he has little clue. He is &amp;lsquo;twice-born&amp;rsquo; when, on living for some time among his chosen tribe, he is able to see things from their view-point.</description></item></channel></rss>
