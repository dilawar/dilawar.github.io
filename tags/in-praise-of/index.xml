One needs not agree or disagree with his praise or condemnation of certain politicians for appreciating his efforts in improving probity in public life. Politicians everywhere are driven by Realpolitik above everything else.</description></item><item><title>In praise of : Secularism</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-01-27-in-praise-of-secularism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2013/2013-01-27-in-praise-of-secularism/</guid><description>A growing tendency in India is to attack secularism, covertly and indirectly. The attack on secularism is somewhat similar to the attack on equality. They maintain since we can not define secularism (like equality) in a strict sense, it will be good if we stop using the term altogether, at least to avoid the intellectual confusion. More adventurous among them will go on to say that it does not exists at all and everything which is called secular is a form of pseudo-secular.</description></item><item><title>In praise of : Ashis Nandy</title><link>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2012/2012-12-17-in-praise-of-ashis-nandy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dilawar.github.io/posts/2012/2012-12-17-in-praise-of-ashis-nandy/</guid><description>To one of his admirers, no less than a Ramachandra Guha, Ashis Nandy is &amp;lsquo;an unclassifiable social scientist&amp;rsquo;. He mixes psychology and philosophy with sociology to a magical effect, some would say to a corrupting effect. I can not imagine anyone who would read him without being deeply influenced. His masterpiece &amp;lsquo;The intimate enemy&amp;rsquo;Â have decolonized some minds. His work continues to have a deep impact on South Asian intellectual culture.</description></item><item><title>Some talks by P.
