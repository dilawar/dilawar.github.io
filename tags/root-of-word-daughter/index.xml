The theory goes like that English &amp;lsquo;daughter&amp;rsquo;, German &amp;lsquo;Tochter&amp;rsquo;, Greek &amp;lsquo;thygater&amp;rsquo;, Irish &amp;lsquo;dear&amp;rsquo;, Lithuanian &amp;lsquo;dukte&amp;rsquo;, Russian &amp;lsquo;doch&amp;rsquo;, are common derivation with the Sankrit root &amp;lsquo;duh&amp;rsquo; (to milk), so the word was, according to this theory, originally &amp;lsquo;dogdhri&amp;rsquo; = she who milks, to indicate that it was the daughter of a primitive aryan family who did the milking. This charming picture was first drawn by Lassen, quoted with approval by Max Muller, plagiarised by various Indian authors in deservedly obscure writings, re-adopted from Marathi and have now gain an unforseen sanctity by the virtue omission and commission during translation.</description></item></channel></rss>
