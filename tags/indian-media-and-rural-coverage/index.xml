This week EPW edition has published a study high-lightening percentage of new-items in Hindi-English media about rural area. This study says that &amp;lsquo;.. India’s highest circulated English and Hindi dailies finds that they devote only a minuscule proportion of their total coverage (about 2%) to rural India’s issues, crises and anxieties. Even this low count could be misleading because most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming.</description></item></channel></rss>
