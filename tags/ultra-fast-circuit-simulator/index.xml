His thesis was on &amp;ldquo;Solution of Network Coupled Partial Differential Equations Through Electrical Analogy&amp;rdquo;.Â Abstract of his thesis :
In the thesis, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are modeled by an electrical circuit generated from the equations arising from the Finite Element Method. This allows the solution of PDEs to be obtained through circuit simulation. One of the objectives of the thesis is to develop an efficient circuit simulator to solve circuits arising out of the electrical analogy for PDEs.</description></item></channel></rss>
